Caretaker Chairman of Ningi Local Government Council of Bauchi State, Nura Dan Maisgari’a has been suspended from office for what was described as dereliction of duties. In a two paged letter of suspension signed by Secretary to the State Government, (SSG), Mohammed Baba Sabiu released to the public on Thursday evening, the suspended Chairman was accused of not performing his official duties as expected of him thereby making administration of the council difficult. The letter contained that, “the way in which you have been frequently absconding from the meeting of Local Government Council Chairmen being convened by the Ministry for Local Government Affairs is the dereliction of responsibilities assigned to your office”. It further contained that, “this is for the fact that the meetings serve as forum in which vital issues regarding local government administration are discussed and decisions are taken accordingly”.

This act violates the principles of representative government like ours. Similarly, the local government is witnessing indiscriminate felling of trees under your watch which is inimical to the avowed commitment of the present administration in combating desertification and environmental issues. Furthermore, you deliberately refused to ractify the recently appointed local government council Secretary whose nomination was in the best interest of the entire Ningi local government”,the statement further contained. The statement then stated that, “it is in the light of the forgoing, I write to convey the approval of the Governor, Sen Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir for your immediate suspension as Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Ningi Local Government Council with immediate effect.
