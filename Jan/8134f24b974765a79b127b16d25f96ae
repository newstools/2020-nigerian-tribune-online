President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, other top officials of the electoral body as well as the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, charging them to ensure a free, fair and credible electoral process in the forthcoming re-run elections in the country. The meeting according to the presidency was a follow-up action on his desire to ensure that the will of the people prevailed in elections. A statement issued by Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, after the meeting, observed that INEC has a minimum of 28 rerun and by-elections this January alone, and President Buhari told the commission to ensure that the game was played by the rules, without fear or favour.

The President said he was determined to give Nigeria an electoral system that meets with best practices anywhere in the world, and charged the electoral umpire to stick to the rules of fair play and adherence to justice. From the police, President Buhari wants nothing than a scrupulous securing of the electoral process, without bias or favouritism. “Our elections must be done in a violence-free atmosphere. The process must be free, fair, decent, devoid of intimidation or malpractices. It is the duty of the police to accomplish that, and it is what I expect in the elections immediately ahead, and going forward,” he said. Both INEC and the police pledged fidelity to the rules and regulations, stating that they know President Buhari as someone passionately committed to fair play.
