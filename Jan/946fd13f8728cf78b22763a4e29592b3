The Managing Director of Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Captain Rabiu Yadudu on Thursday disclosed that Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA) has requisite facilities that could aid the landing of the British Airways (BA) airline at the airport on Tuesday. Captain Yadudu disclosed this during an exclusive chat with select Legislative correspondents while responding to questions on the diversion of the British Airway airline to Accra. The BA crew had on Monday allegedly diverted the Lagos-bound flights to Accra, Ghana, due to absence of functional Instrument Landing System (ILS).

It does not represent what actually happened. “We just finished a meeting with the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation with NAMA. NAMA is going to put out a statement shortly to set the record straight. BREAKING: How intruder gained access to Lagos airport FAAN streamlines protocol activities at airports BREAKING: How robbers broke into Royal Air Maroc plane at… FG set to improve safety, security at airports “BA diverted on its own accord not because they couldn’t land, but because they felt their own SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) demands that they divert. “But the conditions were right for them to land, it was about 5:30 pm, it was not sunset, and the Runway Visual Range (RVR) was about 1800 but their company’s RVR was a bit higher, and nothing says they cannot have a higher one. But our own is 18, our landing condition visual as at that time, they met those conditions. It was because they have a higher standard and they went. “All over the world, different airlines have a standard that is higher than the threshold but nothing says you are not allowed to go below. “So they decided and went to Accra, primarily because Accra happened to be the nearest suitable airport for them, not because there are no other airports. If Abuja was closer they would have gone to Abuja; if Ibadan was well-equipped they would have gone to Ibadan, just for the suitability, because they will get the handling, accommodations, hotels, others. “And I think they avoided Cotonou because it is a French-speaking country, but the next day they came back to Lagos under the same conditions and they landed and we made it clear and asked them, so why didn’t you land yesterday and have to go through the discomfort of carrying passengers overnight to other stations. “I’m not saying everything is perfect but at times there is no need to declare war when there is no war,” he stressed. While expressing concern over the inconveniences imposed on the passengers by the British Airways crew, he observed that there was no violation caused by the crew.
