The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, has paid a sympathy visit to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola, over the recent fire disaster which ravaged the popular Akesan market in the ancient town. Chief Oke, who led the entire state executive committee members as well as leaders and chieftains of the APC from across the state on the visit, expressed sadness over the magnitude of the economic losses occasioned by the fire which as he described as “one disaster too many.” He said: “Akesan market, just like Oyo Alaafin, is a heritage of the Yoruba as its significance extends beyond the value it adds to the nation’s economy. Therefore, any unpleasant happening such as this is not desirable. “As a progressive party which draws a great percentage of its inspiration from the institution of Alaafin of Oyo, we are particularly saddened by this development. “We sympathise with Kabiyesi, the Oyomesi, all victims of the fire incident as well as all sons and daughters of Yorubaland. I am using this opportunity to inform our people that our representatives in Abuja are working seriously to facilitate necessary intervention from the Federal Government and soonest, we shall have good reasons to smile.

We pray God Almighty to prevent future occurrence and provide lasting succour to all the victims, including the family members of those who lost their lives.” In his response, Oba Olayiwola thanked the leadership of the Oyo APC for the visit. He explained the historical background of the burnt market which, according to him, had never suffered such fate before. The traditional ruler used the opportunity to call for the return of the management of significant monuments such as Akesan Market to the palace. The Oyo APC team was received by the Oyomesis, Oyo high chiefs, Bishop Ayo Ladigbolu, notable traditional rulers from Oke-Ogun and Ibarapa areas of the state. The party’s stalwarts in attendance included Chief Lekan Adeyemo, Hoourable Mojeed Olaoya, Chief S. M. Akindele, Alhaji Abdulrasaq Arikeuyo, Chief Ayo Ojebode, Alhaji Moruf Lamolo, Mrs Mabel Williams and Apostle Ezekiel Olaogun.
