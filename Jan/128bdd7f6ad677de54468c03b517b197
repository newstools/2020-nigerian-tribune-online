The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has charged the newly inaugurated commissioners into the State Executive Council, to be accountable to the people and not answerable to any godfather, groups. He said this at the inauguration of 19 commissioners and 16 Special Advisers, held on Friday, at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto Abeokuta. The governor in his speech explained that the delay in the constitution of his cabinet was borne out of his administration’s desire to bring the best hands, ‘game-changers’ on board. Abiodun said that each of the appointees’ performance would be measured by successful implementations of his administration programmes. He urged them to be ambassadors of inclusiveness, justice, fairness and equity.

Some have insinuated the appointment of members of the State Executive Council is late. “Nevertheless, to procure the very best, that is, game-changers who believe in our all-hands-on-deck-approach, team players who will make an impact, one must consult widely. We have thus made sure that the best hands emerged.
