Martin Luther Agwai International Leadership and Peacekeeping Centre (MLAILPC), Jaji, on Friday, graduated 37 Army officers and men trained on awareness on sexual exploitation, abuse and gender mainstreaming course. The commandant of the centre, Maj.-Gen. James Ataguba said that the course was imperative in order to sensitise Nigerian Army officers and soldiers on issues related to sexual exploitation, abuse and gender. Ataguba said that the world at large and the United Nations (UN) in particular, had zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse.

He added that the one-week extensive training which the officers and soldiers had undergone would expose them to some principles and theories, including the development approach of the United Nations Department of Peace Operations. Ataguba urged the officers to apply the training they received appropriately and make efficient and critical use of it to enable them to achieve the objective for which they were sent to the centre.
