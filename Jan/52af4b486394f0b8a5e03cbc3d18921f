Celebrities at the 2020 Grammy Awards paid tribute to Kobe Bryant hours after he and his daughter Gianna, died in a helicopter crash. The NBA icon was flying to Thousand Oaks, California, on Sunday for a basketball game, where Gianna was expected to play and Bryant was expected to coach. At the beginning of the awards red carpet show on Sunday, hosts, Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic honoured the retired NBA legend, who died at 41. Seacrest said: “We are starting the show on a very somber note. We want to take a moment to say we are deeply saddened by the passing of Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and the others aboard the helicopter which tragically crashed today in Calabasas, California.” “Kobe … was one of the greatest basketball players and greatest athletes to ever live. His loss will be felt even more deeply tonight at a place he considered hom, the Staples Center. “We’re sending our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, and the family he left behind. His absence will be felt by so many people that he touched.” Rancic, who also expressed her condolences, said: “As a mother, as a wife, as a human, my heart goes out to Vanessa and their family tonight, first and foremost.” Dj Khaled, who was among the celebrities that grace the Grammy Awards said on the red carpet that the death of the NBA icon was painful, adding it was difficult for them to celebrate in the awards ceremony “God is greatness, a blessing, but you know, we’re doing a tribute for Nipsey Hussle.” ALSO READ: Electoral Act: PDP mandates own lawmakers to begin amendment process “We also want to pay homage and show love to Kobe Bryant, and his daughter, Gianna. The news is devastating. It’s hard to even celebrate, but what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna lift the spirits and pay homage and show love because, like Nipsey would say, the marathon continues.” Also speaking on the red carpet, famous rapper, Wycleff Jean, said he was still trying to “process” the news. “You feel like a hammer hit your heart. This is someone personally I’ve known and spoken to on the phone. You meet this guy and he’s the most incredible, nicest teddy bear. An example to all of us — an idea of how you’re supposed to be with your family and how you’re supposed to be with your kids,” he said. “There’s really no words for it.” Expressing his condolence, US rapper, Rick Ross, described Kobe Bryant as a true champion whom he was pleased to have crossed paths with several times before. “A couple times we came across each other, it was real short and brief. I got the opportunity to let him know I was a fan of his career – he did the same. “I just feel like as a true champion, the champion Kobe was, I believe he would want us to celebrate his legacy, starting with the night, and whoever get on that stage, whoever bring one of those home, they gotta hold it up for the black mamba,” Ross said. In his condolence, American rapper, YBN Cordae, said the NBA superstar’s death was “a complete tragedy.” “It’s just a complete tragedy, man. That’s all you can use to describe it,” he said. “Rest in peace to his daughter. It’s a complete tragedy.” FG responsible for Agba Jalingo’s travials ― Ayade Electoral Act: PDP mandates own lawmakers to begin amendment… Experts warn Nigeria against census politicisation Ganduje seeks approval to borrow N15bn to fund free… SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
