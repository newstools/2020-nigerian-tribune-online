PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday, authorised the use of air power and shelling of forests bordering Kaduna, Niger and Zamfara states, to curtail incessant bandit attacks, kidnapping and cattle rustling in Niger State. A statement issued in Abuja on Sunday said the president had received assurances that with the harmattan dust gradually easing its hold on the skies, fighter aircraft would, this week, join the efforts to provide effective air attacks against bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers that had been attacking remote communities around Dogon Gona forest in Niger State. The president described the repeated attacks leading to the losses of several lives in the communities “as a disaster for the nation,” and consequently authorised the deployment of air power to support troops and policemen deployed to the “difficult terrain,” to counter the menace of the attackers operating in the forest area bordering the states. According to the statement, in line with the directive, the Nigerian Air Force is setting up refueling facilities at Minna, Niger State, to support the aircraft operations, giving assurances that given the improved weather conditions, a major exercise to “visually acquire targets” and launch attacks would soon follow. It said the police command in Niger had equally given assurances that the planned dedicated air raids to complement the police helicopter gunship operations remained the best approach, given the lack of motorised roads in the areas constantly under attack. Buhari commiserated with the government and people of Niger State following the attacks and the loss of lives that followed, while assuring those victim communities in the state would not be abandoned by the rest of the country. In another development, Katsina State government, in conjunction with security forces, on Sunday, demolished another house being used as a hideout by bandits in Yartalata village of Kafur Local Government Area of the state El-rufai inaugurates N10bn tomatoes farm in Kaduna Buhari attends niece’s wedding in Abuja NANS to Buhari: Sack service chiefs now Buhari felicitates Amosun at 62 Addressing newsmen before the demolition, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Gambo Isa, said the house belonged to a kingpin of bandits in the area.

According to Isa, during the operation, the police found the victim chained in a hut on the premises. The PPRO said the SARS succeeded in arresting one of the suspected bandits whose name was given as Bello, while two others lost their lives during a gun duel. The arrested suspect, who led the joint team of the military, police, DSS and the press to the location of the demolition, confessed to have participated in the kidnapping of Lawal on January 4 and demanded for N15 million ransom. He said he was lured into the criminal act by other gang members already killed by the police. The four-bedroom mud house located on a Fulani settlement was thereafter demolished with two tractors in the presence of newsmen and armed security personnel headed by Major Ibrahim from the 35 Batallion, Katsina.
