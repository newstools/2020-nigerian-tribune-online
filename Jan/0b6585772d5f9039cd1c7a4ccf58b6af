THE Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), on Tuesday, disclosed that it had fully commenced the payment of the new minimum wage of N30, 000 to the staff of the administration. Director, FCT Treasury Department, Mr Ismaila Ishiaku, who disclosed this to newsmen in Abuja, announced that the minimum wage backlog arrears of N4 billion from April 2019 had also been cleared. According to him: “The minimum wage was to start, effective from April 2019 but its implementation began in December, and because the directive from the Federal Government came after we in the FCT had already paid the December salary because we pay very early.

We calculated the arrears from April to December. In other words, we have paid the minimum wage from April to December last year, because the effective date for the new minimum wage based on the agreement with labour was April 2019. “The arrears we cleared was about N4 billion. Now, we have also prepared the January salary with the minimum wage. So, FCTA is on the move. There is no issue of backlog and the payment was not in instalments. We paid everything at once.” He added. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
