No fewer than 299 Workers disengaged from the services of the Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado-Ekiti last year have given the management of the institution a 30-day ultimatum to reinstate them or face legal action. The workers, in a letter written by their Olabanjo Ayenakin of Banjo Ayenakin & Co entitled ‘ Letter on notice and pre-action notice’ dated January 22, 2020, was addressed to the Registrar of the institution, Mr Olusola Arogundade. In a copy of the letter made available to journalists in Ado-Ekiti on Friday, the workers alleged that they were unlawfully disengaged from the institution. Ayenakin said, “We the solicitors to Mrs Oyinlola Omowumi Yinka, Mr Oke Sanmi and Mr Idowu Lawrence Tosin (for themselves and on behalf of the 299 technologists, non-teaching senior staff and junior staff of your institution, who were employed in 2016, but who were unlawfully disengaged on 5th December 2019 of EKSU who are herein referred to as our client and on whose behalf this letter is caused to be written to you. ” The appointments of our clients were regular and proper; contrary to the insinuation that the appointments were irregular,” are seeking “immediate restatement of our clients; and payment of all the salaries of our clients which your institution owed them before they were wrongfully disengaged from their appointments.” Technical education panacea to unemployment, insecurity ―… Education in Nigeria is in decline ― Don Government to reconstruct Ado-Ekiti township roads LG poll: Ekiti deputy gov warns APC members against violence ALSO READ:  Zulum pays N30,000 minimum wage to civil servants in Borno The lawyers are also seeking “payment of all our clients’ salaries from the time of disengagement till now and thereafter; and promotion of our clients to the deserved position without prejudice to the disengagement.” Ayenakin stated that EKSU disengaged “our clients on the ground that their services were no longer required when our clients had not committed any offence, infraction or any act of misconduct and when our clients were not queried, disciplined or made to face any disciplinary panel.” According to him, the Committee of the Governing Council had refused to budge even when the affected workers, in accordance with the letter of disengagement issued to them, “individually appealed to it that they committed no offence and that their disengagements were wrongful, null and void”. The lawyer stated, “Evidently, the disengagement of our clients in the manner in which it was done smacks of illegality and the same is apparently malicious and devoid of fair hearing. The disengagement of our clients from their appointments is a direct affront and suspicious violation of the conditions of services of our clients as enshrined in the regulations of your university. “Take notice that if your institution fails or refuses to reinstate our clients and accede to all other ancillary requests contained in this letter within 30 days from the date on this letter, we have our clients’ instruction to seek the reliefs contained herein, and that time, we shall not hesitate to seek relief bothering on aggravated damages against your institution,” Ayenakin stated.
