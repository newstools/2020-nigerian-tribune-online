Despite challenges that characterised the power sector in 2019, Ikeja Electric Plc (IE), said it recorded several achievements last year including the reduction in Aggregated Technical and Commercial Collection (ATC&C) losses, the introduction of e-billing system and improved sustainable power through its bilateral agreements. According to a statement signed by the Head of Corporate Communications, Ikeja Electric, Felix Ofulue, Ikeja Electric’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Folake Soetan, noted that Ikeja Electric took a bold step towards improved sustainable power through the bilateral initiative. According to her, the company had successfully reduced her ATC&C losses from about 31.3 per cent last year to 24.5 per cent presently. ATC & C refers to reduction, which is the difference between the amount of electricity received by a Distribution Company from the Transmission Company and the amount of electricity for which it invoices its customers plus the loss of the adjusted collection.
