President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday advised Nigerian youths to brace up for leadership roles because “whether we like it or not, we will someday handover to Nigerian youths.” The President, who received All Progressives Congress (APC) youth leaders from the six geo-political zones, at the presidential villa, Abuja on Friday said: “With all certainty, someday you will have to take up the mantle of leadership in this country, and you should be prepared for huge responsibilities.” The president advised the younger generation to keep a broader view of the country as one entity, and continuously de-emphasise ethnic and religious backgrounds in nation-building.

This is what pushed me into partisan politics; to serve with integrity.  So I decided to try leadership as a civilian, after taking off the military uniform,’’ he added. On his second tenure, the President assured that he would be more firm, focused and relentless in delivering results, especially in securing the country, stimulating the economy to work for all, and fighting corruption. “I am currently serving my last term in office. I swore by the constitution to defend the country, and I will do the needful for the country,’’ President Buhari said. In his remarks, National Youth Leader of the APC, Comrade Sadiq Shuaibu Abubakar, congratulated the President for winning the Presidential elections in 2019, assuring him that the youths will continue to support his policies and vision of greatness for the country. Abubakar urged the President to get more youths involved in governance so as to learn from his “treasured wisdom.” STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
