Speaking during the award night, the Director-General of NIMASA, Dr Dakuku Peterside, noted the significant change in the reputation of the agency in the last few years, saying that the burnished image was part of the fruits of the management’s deliberate effort to change the old ways of doing things in the industry and the agency, for the overall good of the economy. He highlighted some of the achievements of the agency, in the last three years to include the Final Billing regime, which has significantly reduced turnaround time for all vessel billing transactions from between five and 10 years to two weeks of the ship’s departure; increased tonnage, with Nigeria currently placing second in Africa, after Liberia and reduction of turnaround time for issuance of Sailing Clearance from about one year to 14 days.
