THE 2020 edition of Shafaudeen in Islam Worldwide’s annual convention (Ishrat) was held recently at the organisation’s headquarters in Wakajaye, Iwo Road, Ibadan, Oyo State. The founder, spiritual head and grand imam of the organisation, Professor Sabitu Olagoke, launched two books to commemorate the event. A lecture entitled ‘Nigeria’s Socio-Economic Enhancement: An Antidote to National Disintegration’ was delivered by Professor Olagoke, where he stated that in Nigeria, all indicators of development are within the axis of operating “kleptocracy in democracy and the regime of poverty in an economy that is artisan-driven, importation-dependent with unending debt servicing and massive corruption.” Lamenting that insecurity, injustice and inequality and profanity permeate the environment and are undermining Nigeria’s democracy, Olagoke noted that all these malfeasances are creating a wide gap between governance and development. The scholar, in offering panaceas for some of the problems facing the country, said only through successful election process could good governance driven by credible and visionary leaders who will use power to serve the people rather than for self-enrichment emerge. He urged government at all levels to avoid wasteful spending and advocated the replacement of the presidential system of government with the parliamentary system.

The books, The Parrot, the Kangaroo and the Family and The Society for Nation Building, were launched by notable Nigerians. The event also witnessed awards presentation to organisations and individuals who have impacted their professions and their environments positively. One of the dignitaries at the event, Professor Abass Adedibu, commended Olagoke for the annual convention, saying that this year’s edition was even better than previous ones.
