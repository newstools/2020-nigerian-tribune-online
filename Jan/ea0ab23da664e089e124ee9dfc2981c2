Fani-Kayode is on trial for the offence alongside a former Minister of State for Finance, Nenadi Usman; Danjuma Yusuf, and a firm, Joint Trust Dimensions Ltd. Justice Rilwan Aikawa fixed the date following the absence of the counsel for Yusuf and Joint Trust Dimensions Ltd, Mr Clement Onwuenwuenor.
