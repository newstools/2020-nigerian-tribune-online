The present federal structure is too faulty and unsustainable. The fallacious federalism we practice in Nigeria is dubious, fictitious and fraudulent. If the true federalism is what we indeed practice, I bet this issue would not have arisen at all. Additionally, this sad situation is only a quick reminder that this centralized policing system is inefficient, weak and unsustainable in a federal system. There would have been no need for Operation Amotekun in the first place if our security agencies have not failed in their primary duty to safeguard the lives and properties of the citizens. With the growing rate of banditry, kidnapping, herdsmen attacks, terrorism and others, one would expect a strong and efficient policing system. What do one expect the helpless citizens to do when the state security has failed? Self-help and self-defense, provided for under Section 33(2)(a), which is inimical to the corporate existence of the country. Although I am not an ethnic bigot, I make bold to say there is a growing rate of social and political inequality in the country. Yes, I know verily that it is improper to justify a ‘wrong’ by making reference to another wrong elsewhere. The attitude of the AGF, condemning one and maintaining a bias neutrality on the other, is at best hypocritical and a show of one-sidedness. This unfairness and biasness should give all desirous of the continuous existence of Nigeria a cause to worry. In Conclusion, Operation Amotekun has its many flaws that must be quickly remedied by the relevant parties. First, it is merely a reactionary initiative and that is precarious. Again, the stakeholders in charge were beclouded by emotions and were in a rush while birthing the idea without necessarily dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s. It is uncontestable that the initiative is a great one but the planning and implementation were so poor. Be that as it may, the idea is a progressive one that must be supported by all patriots. Amotekun: Some lessons in history NSE: Sell-offs reduce gains at 0.03% Biblical support for Amotekun How I started my award-winning cake business with pocket… The benefit in Amotekun is far beyond the challenges and inadequacies. I hereby enjoin the stakeholders to ensure the enactment of an enabling law establishing Amotekun in the six South West states. Although, even if an enabling law is established to that effect, it would in no way affect the legality of the Operation when viewed from Malami’s lens. I also suggest that the operation manuals of the team should be made public for all and sundry to read so as the initiative not to get misunderstood. For the Governors, I charge them never to be cowed or bow to pressure. This is a challenging time that the initiators must never comprise standard for cheap political reason by standing strong on their grounds and at their suffering people.
