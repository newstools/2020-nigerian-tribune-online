A former vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos, Akoka, Professor Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe, has expressed his full support for the whistleblowing policy against perpetrators of sexual harassment and other forms of immoral acts by lecturers in the tertiary institutions in Nigeria. He also advocated the constitution of a committee involving academics, administrators and government representatives to look critically into the controversial Federal Government’s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) and iron out the technical and peculiar aspects of the policy such as hiring and firing of workers. Professor Ibidapo-Obe made the remarks recently on the sideline of the 11th convocation ceremony of Crawford University, Igbesa, Ogun State, a faith-based private university. He said for any male lecturer to sexually harass his female students for whatever reason is uncalled for and therefore totally condemnable. “The act is terrible morally and also lowers the prestige universities are trying to attach to their products,” he stressed. #ThursdayTales: Two friends and a fool Body parts for N90,000!
