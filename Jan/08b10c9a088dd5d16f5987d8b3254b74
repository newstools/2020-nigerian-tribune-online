Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Monday swore three new members of the State Executive Council, members of the Civil Service Commission and five permanent secretaries, charging them to kick off action immediately. The governor gave the charge during the swearing-in exercise which took place at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, urging the new appointees to further add value to the administration towards delivering democratic dividends to Lagosians. He said the new appointees were called to serve from the pool of numerous competent and highly qualified Lagosians, saying they must work hard to justify the confidence reposed in them with the appointment. “You have been brought on to add value in our quest to deliver the dividend of democracy to the citizens. We are pushing the emblem of our party and we have started implementing several programmes under our project T.H.E.M.E.S.

Time will come and time will go but it is what we do with the time that they will judge us with. The essence of this reminder is to keep each and every one of us on the go and to let you know that we need to hit the ground running,” the governor said. Sanwo-Olu said the new appointees and others in government cannot afford to be complacent in their approach to governance as there was so much to be accomplished within the remaining days to spend in office, declaring that his government cannot afford not to succeed.
