Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has sent hearty felicitations to Plateau State Governor and Chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum, Simon Bako Lalong on his victory at the Supreme Court. Bello, in a statement issued on Monday by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, said the judgement of the Supreme Court affirming the election of Lalong was no doubt a well-deserved victory and confirmation of the overwhelming support given to him by the people of Plateau. He said the verdict of the erudite panel of Justices of the Supreme Court led by Justice Adamu Galinje, affirming Lalong as the validly elected governor of Plateau State has now put an end to the torturous journey of a legal battle.
