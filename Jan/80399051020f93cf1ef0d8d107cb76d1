The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as yet another sad commentary on the nation’s democratic order, the Supreme Court’s catapult of Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressive Congress (APC) from the fourth position in the last Imo State gubernatorial election to the first position. From the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) after the March 9, 2019 election, Uzodinma came fourth behind Ihedioha, Uche Nwosu of the Action Alliance (AA), and Ifeanyi Ararume of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). In its reaction to the apex court’s sacking of its candidate, Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, on Tuesday, a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary said: “The finds it difficult to understand how Senator Uzodinma/APC, who came 4th in the March 9, 2019 governorship election, with just 96,458 votes, will suddenly, by the token of the judgment of the Supreme Court, defeat Gov Emeka Ihedioha/PDP that scored 276,404 votes.

The PDP added: “The people of Imo state are now confronted with the challenge of having a government that they cannot identify with and which cannot connect with them, having not emanated from them. “Moreover, all the gains, including the development and stability already achieved by the people-based government, under Governor Emeka Ihedioha/PDP administration in the state are now heavily jeopardized. “Indeed, the mournful and despondent ambience that now pervades in Imo State is a loud testimony that the judgment did not reflect the expectation of the people of Imo State as expressed at the polls.” While recognising that the judgment of the Supreme Court is final, the PDP, however, urged all party stakeholders in the state to remain united and calm, and await further instruction from the national leadership on this very sad development.
