The Federal High Court on Monday in Abuja convicted one Oluwaseyi Anifowoshe to eight years imprisonment for her involvement in drug trafficking. Anifowoshe who was charged on two counts was sentenced to four years for the first count and four years for the second. Justice Okon Abang said that both terms of imprisonment were to run concurrently from the date of arrest which was Oct 25, 2017. He ordered the convict to submit her International passport to the Federal Government alongside her E-ticket to the prosecution. He also ordered that the 500 rand found in her possession and all other exhibits be sold and remitted to the Federal Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Anifowoshe was before the court in an amended two counts charge dated Jan11 and filed Jan 15.

Count one of the charge attracts a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of 25 years in prison while count two attracts life imprisonment on conviction. Anifowoshe was sometime in 2017 arrested at the Nnamdi Azikwe Airport, Abuja by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in possession of 1.9kg of cocaine and 3kg of Ephedrine. She was arrested during an outward clearance of Ethiopia Airline to Johannesburg, South Africa through Addis Ababa. The convict initially pleaded not guilty to the charge levelled against her by the NDLEA, but later pleaded guilty on Jan 22.

Justice Abang cautioned Anifowoshe for making herself available to a fraudster. “What made you not to check the bags given to you and you agreed to carry them with you to a country you had never been to. “You cannot just have a university degree and not be intelligible because much is expected of you. “If you were a dropout, it would be understandable. “She allowed someone she met on Facebook to influence her instead of her to look for gainful employment; self-employment, privately or publicly employed,” he said.

The Judge said that he was inclined although reluctant to give the convict the opportunity to turn a new leaf. “I will show compassion and give her the opportunity to be a useful person. “I hope she will take advantage of the lenient position of the court to have a second chance,” he said. NAN also reports that during and after the judgement, Anifowoshe wept uncontrollably, but jubilated when the Judge concluded his judgement. NAN SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
