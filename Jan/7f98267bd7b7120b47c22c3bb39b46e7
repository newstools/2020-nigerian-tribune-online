Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria may in for another challenge as they cannot lend the money but must keep over N855.3 billion in their vaults, on site or at the central bank, in order to meet any large and unexpected demand for withdrawals. This is as a result of of the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank which increased their Cash Reserves Ratio (CRR) from 22.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The MPC members on Friday voted 9 to 11 and increased the CRR by 500 basis points (bps) to 27.5 per cent while holding other policy parameters constant ? MPR at 13.5per cent, Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent and Asymmetric corridor at +200bps/-500bps around the MPR. According to an investment research analysts at both Afrinvest (West) Africa Limited and Zedcrest Capital Limited this CRR increase is expected to quarantine between ?812.6 to ?855.3 billion from the banks’ vaults given total deposits ranging from ?16.2 to ?17.1 trillion as at September 2019. Abiodun Karipe, an Investment research analyst at Afrinvest and Oluwatosin Ayanfalu of Zedcrest Capital Limited,the Committee noted that the increase in Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LDR) and Open Market Operation (OMO) restriction has raised liquidity level while the land border closure continues to push inflation (Dec’19: 11.9%).
