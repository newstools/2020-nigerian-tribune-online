He said though no amount of money or material donations can replace the lost souls, assistance by the agency will go along way to rehabilitate and revamp the community. The Director General eulogised the proactive measures of the senator seeking relief for the people he represented. Maihaja, however, promised to conduct a site assessment of the community so as to ascertain the kind of relief materials needed. He added that both the assessment and deployment of relief materials to the community would be completed by the weekend.
