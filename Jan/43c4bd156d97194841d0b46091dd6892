The task of making the Nigerian Postal Services (NIPOST) profitable is one that must be accomplished. The Postmaster-General of NIPOST, Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, said this on Thursday to the staff members of the organisation in Lagos. Adewusi, who led other top management staff members of NIPOST on a facility tour of the organization in Lagos, said President Muhammadu Buhari, has mandated the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to raise NIPOST to global standards in delivering quality services to its customers. Facilities inspected on the first day of the tour which would run for two days include the International Mail Processing Centre, NAHCO Centre, at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos, Post Office, Oshodi, General Post Office, Marina, Philately Department, NIPOST Lafiaji and the NIPOST courier services regulatory centre, Lagos Island. In company with the NIPOST boss was the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mrs Nwakanma Loreto. Adewusi said it would amount to self-delusion to pretend there are no challenges facing the organisation, adding that it’s only in facing those challenges that they would be surmounted. He said he was in Lagos to get first hand information on the state of infrastructure and the operations of the company with a view to delivering on the mandate he has to breathe life into the organisation.
