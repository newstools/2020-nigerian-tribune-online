He, however, urged individuals to imbibe the culture of proper documentation of their life stories and milestones for the purpose of inspiring young entrepreneurs. He said: “The culture of business schools is to have successful entrepreneurs tell their stories, highlight their experiences, challenges and what they have done differently that have made them successful. This is what happens in most countries of the world. “But in Nigeria, we cannot even tell the stories of successful entrepreneurs. A lot of them do not have track records. There are no much records about the majority of those who really worked hard to attain success. “People know that they are successful, but when you research into their life’s stories, you really do not see much. We should begin to document our journey all the way. We do not have to wait to achieve success to do this. This is the only way we can break this jinx.”  Nigerian Tribune STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS. CLICK NOW.
