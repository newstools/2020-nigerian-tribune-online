Police in Oyo State arraigned a 70-year-old cleric, Sule Shaibu, and his two assistants, Wasiu Salami and Francis Akinola, before an Iyaganku Magistrates’ Court sitting in Ibadan on Wednesday for allegedly obtaining N36million from a woman to solve her “spiritual problems”. The cleric, 55-year-old Salami and 45-year-old Akinola, are charged with three counts of conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretences and fraudulent conversion. The prosecution counsel, Sgt. Olalekan Adegbite, told the court that Shuaib, Salami and Akinola and others at large, obtained N36million from Madam Olayinka Ishioye in 2015, with a promise to provide spiritual solutions for him, a representation he knew was false.
