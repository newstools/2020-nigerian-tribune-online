Elated by the approval of construction of new 11 roads in some parts of Delta State by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain, Chief Sunny Onuesoke, has described the gesture as a promise kept. Governor Okowa, he said, is adhering to his promise of rehabilitation and construction of roads in the nooks and crannies of the oil-rich state. Onuesoke, in a chat with journalists on Friday, pointed out that Governor Okowa’s award, construction, completion and eventual opening of scores of roads since he assumed office attest to the truth that he is a promise keeper who is committed to the even development of the state. He added that if there was one area among others in which the administration of Governor Okowa has excelled, it was in the development of roads and physical infrastructure in Delta State. “Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s road imprints are now seen everywhere across Delta State. “In Asaba, the capital of Delta State, we have lost count of the number of roads the Delta State government has constructed or refurbished.

Places where princes feared to tread,” he stated. Onuesoke disclosed that one novel thing about the roads embarked upon by the Delta State government was that they seemed to concentrate on economic roads that would positively affect the economic fortunes of the people in the affected areas. He explained that Governor Okowa’s interest in roads construction was borne out of the desire to open up the state for investors. “Besides making the communities accessible, the roads are concentrated in economic routes that are very vital to the socio-economic development of our people. “The roads will attract investors, create job opportunities and contribute to the development of Delta State,” he disclosed. He maintained that the governor’s action was all-inclusive by carrying all regions along, adding that the aim of governance was to please all regions and not to pacify only one region. Onuesoke, therefore, appealed to people of the state to put party differences aside and support Okowa in his development strides of Delta State. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
