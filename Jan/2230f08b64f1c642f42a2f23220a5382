The only ANPP lawmaker in the Bauchi State House of Assembly representing Bauchi Central constituency, Jamilu Umaru Dahiru has described the Supreme Court Judgement upholding the election of Sen Bala Mohammed as the duly elected Governor of Bauchi State as a victory for the down-trodden electorates who defied sun and heat to come out and vote for him in the 2019 general elections. Jamilu Umaru Dahiru in a press statement while responding to the historic apex court judgment, noted however that it was a run-over judgment as the Elections Petition Tribunal in Bauchi and an Appellate Court in Jos have already upheld the election of Senator Bala Mohammed as the duly elected governor of Bauchi state. Jamilu Umaru Dahiru, therefore, commended the Judiciary for its just and fair judgment not only as regard the case of Senator Bala Mohammed, but in virtually all the adjudicatory cases dispensed by the various courts, and urged it to maintain the tempo for the peaceful co-existence of the diverse ethnic groups of the country. The legislator who is the House Committee Chairman on Public Account appealed to the people of Bauchi state to give Governor Bala Mohammed the necessary support and cooperation to enable him fulfills his electioneering campaign promises, especially in delivering democracy dividends to the electorates. The ANPP Lawmaker reassured his support to the PDP administration in Bauchi on any developmental aspect in the collective resolve towards moving the state to the next level, hence the need for all hands to be on deck to take the state to higher pedestals.
