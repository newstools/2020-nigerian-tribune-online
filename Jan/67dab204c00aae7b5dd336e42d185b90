The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has launched its digitisation initiative for Downstream operations under the ‘Automated Downstream System’ (ADS) program. According to a statement by Head of Public Affairs, DPR, Mr Paul Osu, and made available to the Tribune Online, on Thursday, the digitisation initiative is designed to improve overall efficiency and accelerate DPR Downstream Regulatory performance by reducing application processing time, enhance transparency, provide platform for accurate Downstream statistics, integrate with other stakeholders for document verification purposes and improve revenue collection. “The ADS is in line with DPR’s alignment with government’s ease of doing business policy which is geared towards economic growth. The initiative comprises amongst others, the following licenses and permits: ALSO READ: Senate to probe $396m spent on turnaround maintenance of refineries “Retail Outlet Monitoring (ROMS) license for kerosene peddlers, Retail stations and industrial consumers; Import/Export Permit (IMPEX) for Petroleum products; Coastal Vessel Licence (CVL); Lube Oil Blending Plant Licence (LOBL); Depot Licence (DL) and Refining Processing Licence (RPL),” it said.

The department has also introduced the Smart Inspector solution to ease technical inspection, real-time data gathering and monitoring of oil and gas facilities to ensure safety and regulatory compliance. The digitisation initiatives of the DPR are integrated into the Corporate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application system which is the platform for business system automation. DPR said will continue to provide robust regulatory oversight for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria in furtherance of its vision to be a leading regulator in the global oil and gas space.
