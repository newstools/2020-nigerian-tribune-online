The CP said the tactic teams of the Command were after the criminals for days before their eventual arrest. He said, “On the 10th of January, 2020, the command received information about the kidnap of a newly nominated member of Remo North local government caretaker committee, one Hon. Soniyi Taiwo along Fidiwo-Ipara road while coming from an outing. “On receiving the information, I directed the DPO Isara division to work in conjunction with other tactical teams in the command to ensure the rescue of the victim unhurt. In compliance with my directive, the team swung into action and embarked on a technical and forensic investigation as a result of which kidnappers were quickly geo-located. “Having realised that the Police are closing in on them, the hoodlums released their victim but three members of the gang were subsequently apprehended as a result of intense combing of the bush where they were traced to. Their arrest led to the arrest of the fourth suspect who was tracked to Idi-Ayunre in Ibadan. “I want to use this opportunity to sound a note of warning to all would-be criminals to either have a rethink or relocate from Ogun State as their refusal to do any of the two will lead them to total destruction because the command will be taking the battle to their doorstep.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
