JUSTICE Abubakar Idris Kultigi of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), sitting at Gwagwalada, Abuja, today granted bail to a former Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bello Adoke. Adoke is arraigned before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alongside six others on a 42-count charge bordering on accepting gratification, granting tax waiver, forgery, among others. Others standing trial with the former AGF are Aliyu Abubakar; Rasky Gbinigie; Malabu Oil and Gas Limited; Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited; Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.
