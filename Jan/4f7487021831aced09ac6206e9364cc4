Vice chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Professor Kolawole Salako, has asked pro-chancellors of universities of agriculture in the country  to prevail on the Federal Government to restore management science courses to the institutions. Professor Salako said this while addressing members of the newly-formed Committee of Pro-chancellors of Federal Universities of Agriculture in Nigeria (CPFUAN) drawn from the FUNAAB; Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi (FUAM); and the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU). Represented at the committee’s maiden meeting by the deputy vice chancellor (academics), Professor Morenike Dipeolu, the VC noted that agricultural programmes could not exist in isolation of other disciplines. While adding that every human development programme is required in an agrarian community, Professor Salako, urged other sister universities to fully work to achieve the restoration of management courses back to them. Professor Salako said: “If agriculture must be a business to provide employment for a huge part of our population, then programmes which play key roles in value-addition of agricultural products must be included in our curricula.” Snacking on watermelon beneficial for weight control —Study FG collaborates with D-8’s hespi in rehabilitation of health… Security  topmost on our agenda —UCH JAMB should be scrapped – Asaju, ACU VC Members of the CPFUAN also agreed at the meeting to work harmoniously to transform agriculture from theoretical into the practice level, particularly on the restoration of management sciences to universities of agriculture in the country.
