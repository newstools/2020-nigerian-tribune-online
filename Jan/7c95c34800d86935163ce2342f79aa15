The Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed January 13 to hear the suit against the Nigerian Government following the electrocution of five inmates of Ikoyi Medium Security Custodial Centre (formerly Ikoyi Prison). The Prisoners’ Rights Advocacy Initiative, which is the advocacy group that filed the suit, asked the court to compel the government to build more correctional centres in Lagos and across the country. Joined in the suit are the Federal Government of Nigeria, Attorney-General of the Federation, Minister of Interior, Controller-General of the Nigerian Correctional Services, Lagos State Controller of Correctional Service and the Attorney-General of Lagos State. PRAI is also praying the court to grant an order that the service begins the decongestion of the court and also release those who did not go through a proper trial.
