The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E. A. Adeboye, has thrown his weight behind a three-day fasting and prayer declaration for Nigeria by the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). In a memo titled “Call for Prayers and Advocacy by the Christian Association of Nigeria,” released by the church body from the office of the assistant general overseer (admin & personnel), RCCG, Pastor Adeboye enjoined all members and parishes in the church to fast and pray for Nigeria. The national leadership of CAN presided over by Rev (Dr) Samson Ayokule, had declared a three-day- national fasting and prayer against insecurity of lives and properties in Nigeria.

The RCCG in its statement states that: “The Christian Association of Nigeria, the umbrella body of all Christians and Christian organisation in Nigeria, has made a clarion call for prayers and advocacy to all Christians in Nigeria in response to the inhumane acts against Christians in the country Lagos-Ibadan Expressway: More than 75 buildings in RCCG axis… Christian persecutions are real in Nigeria, group replies… Northern govs condemn killing of CAN chairman Again, terrorists kill officer, seven soldiers in Borno The general overseer has, therefore, directed that all members of RCCG participate in this prayer and advocacy” It will be recalled that the RCCG is currently on a fasting and praying programme, the memo, therefore, states that prayers during the period of this fasting and advocacy between  Friday 31st January and Sunday 2nd February 2020, should be focused on prayers against the gruesome killings of innocent people in the country and also prayer for the government to develop capacity to overcome the criminals troubling the nation. It also states that a special prayer walk should be conducted by all parishes in the RCCG on Sunday 2nd 2020 and all parishes are enjoined to close the thanksgiving service of that Sunday early and prayers should be focused on God’s intervention in the ongoing situation of the country. Recall that CAN had strongly registered its discontent with the state of affairs in Nigeria, particularly the security situation in the country. It had repeatedly called for the sack and replacement of service chiefs with people that would bring fresh ideas and solution to the security problem in Nigeria. The RCCG, therefore, advised that all parishes with functional social media handles should publicise the prayer and advocacy while using appropriate captions and hashtags. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
