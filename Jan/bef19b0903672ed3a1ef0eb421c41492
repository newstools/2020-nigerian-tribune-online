It was gathered that the abduction of Okoye occurred about 7:30 pm on Wednesday night when the armed men numbering about seven attacked the Imiringi residence of the businessman. According to the victims, the kidnappers who were dressed in military and Police uniforms arrived in a white Hilux vehicle with registration number GBB 30 FS abducted the victims and escaped through Onuebum Community in Ogbia LGA where a getaway boat was stationed.

They must have been waiting before he walked in. “Series of save-our-soul messages were sent out to the emergency lines of the State Commissioner of Police and the Operation Puff Adder led by DSP Chris Nwaogbo. And because of their swift response, they were able to rescue the victims after a gun battle with the kidnappers.” A policeman who pleaded anonymity because he does not have authority to speak on the issue said that “one policeman was injured on his shoulder in the process but the kidnappers abandoned their vehicle and the victims. They ran into the bush as they could not withstand the police. The bullet-ridden Hilux of the kidnappers has been recovered.” Contacted on the development, the spokesman of the State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the development and assured that a statement would be issued on the incident soon.
