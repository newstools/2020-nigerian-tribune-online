The North-East caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it has no anointed candidate for the office of the national secretary of the party. The position became vacant sequel to the emergence of Mallam Mai Mala Buni, the former occupant as incumbent governor of Yobe state. The deputy national secretary of the party, Victor Giadom, has since assumed the position in an acting capacity. Contenders for the position zoned to the North-East geo-political zone include Barrister Muhammed Bello Mustapha, Architect Idris Bulama and acting Director-General of National Orientation Agency, Dr Garba Abari from Taraba, Borno and Yobe states, respectively. But the North-East caucus in a communique read to newsmen on Monday by its publicity secretary, Ilyasu Habeb, dispelled insinuation that a certain aspirant has been endorsed for the position.
