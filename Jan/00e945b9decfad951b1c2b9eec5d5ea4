The presidency has told the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that it has no business discussing “the love lust” between President Muhammadu Buhari and his governing All Progressive Congress (APC). A statement issued in Abuja, on Thursday, by the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, admonished the main opposition party to focus on its problems, describing the PDP as the obstacle to the push for change in the country. The presidency’s statement is in apparent response to the PDP’s earlier assertion that President Buhari’s apprehensions that the APC will fizzle out before 2023 was a weighty forewarning to Nigerians not to put any hope whatsoever in the APC. The presidency stated: “As the People’s Democratic Party, the country’s main opposition party grapples with deeply troubling questions about its terminal decline and future in national politics, Nigerians must be surprised reading a statement issued by them, assuming the role of Spokesmen for “President Muhammadu Buhari.

Instead of doing that, they are taking roles for themselves that are not mandated by law, morality or political gamesmanship. “What business do they have issuing a statement on the love or the lack of it between the President and his party? This is not why they lost elections. The party needs a reboot that aligns with current national mood and aspirations, to focus on their grim future after two successive defeats. It is the issue they need to focus on if they are to be taken as a serious opposition party again. “A tough task awaits anyone leading a party with nothing to offer to contemporary Nigerians but corruption, misgovernance and division. “As for the APC, the geographical expansion of the party is nothing short of a testimony to the rosy future that lies ahead. The party has come to stay, and the President and the country will ensure that this is achieved.” STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
