The entire members of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ibadan South-West local government area of Oyo State on Wednesday dumped the party and joined the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The defectors were led into the party by a former commissioner in the state, Hon Asimiyu Ado. Receiving the new members at the local government meeting of the PDP held at the premises of the United Missionary College (UMC), the state chairman of the party, Alhaji Kunmi Mustapha, noted that the Lamidi Adidibu political family in the state was being solidified. He expressed delight that many of the disciples of the strongman of Ibadan politics that had left the party were returning.
