Fulani and other community leaders have been arrested following the recent killings in Bokkos local government area of Plateau State where 22 people were recently killed. The arrested leaders have been transferred to the Police headquarters in Abuja for further interrogation. This is just as the 22 persons killed in the local government were given a mass burial on Thursday amidst wailing and crying by sympathisers who thronged the burial ground in their hundreds. It would be recalled that Governor Simon Lalong on Tuesday ordered the arrest of Ardos, the Fulani and community leaders in the troubled local government area where 23 people were killed last Sunday. State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ubah Gabriel, confirmed the arrest of 11 of the leaders on both sides. He said those arrested have been transferred to the Police Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday morning. But a source close to the police revealed that 25 of the leaders who were in Government House for meeting with the governor were whisked to the state police command and profiled accordingly. It was further learnt that the community leaders and their Fulani counterparts from Mangu, Barakin-Ladi and Riyom local governments which have been experiencing killings were also invited for questioning.

Business activities in the local government were paralysed as people abandoned their works to pay their last respects to the victims of the attack. Meanwhile, a former Speaker of Plateau State House of Assembly, Hon Istifanus Mwamsat, faulted the arrest and subsequent transfer of those arrested in connection to the killing. Hon Mwamsat said since the offence was committed in Plateau State, both the interrogation and prosecution should be done in the state for the sake of transparency, adding that it was a ploy to give room for interference. Mwamsat said: “History is repeating itself in Plateau State, we have had situations in the past where those arrested for a similar criminal act with sophisticated weapons were arrested and taken to Abuja but only to find their ways back to the community or back to the trenches. “We are tired of this gimmick on the Plateau, what is in Abuja that is not in Plateau State? The act was committed here, they should be prosecuted here. Based on experience, it is better they are not arrested at all than taking them to Abuja only to be set free.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
