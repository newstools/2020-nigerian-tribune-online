The EFCC Prosecution Counsel, Mr Sadiq Bashir, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Oct. 13, 2019, within Osogbo metropolis before he was apprehended.

He said the offence committed contravened Section (1) (A) (3) of the Advance Free fraud and other related offences Act 2006. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of fraud and impersonation preferred against him.
