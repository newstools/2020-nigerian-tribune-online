Permit me a space in your medium to draw the attention of the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, to the snail speed and poor execution of road rehabilitation from Zaria to Pambegua awarded to the Proportion Construction and Dredge Works Limited. The rehabilitation of the road which was awarded by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in 2017 has become an eyesore. Even from Zaria where the works commenced, one could notice depression and potholes dotting the newly rehabilitated portion of road; the drainage system is poorly constructed. The poor condition of road has led to the death of many commuters who ply the road on daily basis. It is sad to note that the road has become a death trap while men of the underworld have taken over, carrying out their nefarious activities with relative ease because of its bad shape.

I think the relevant authorities should visit the site because while other similar road rehabilitation contracts awarded the same year with Zaria to Pambegua have since been completed and put to use, we are left with lamentations due to poor handling of the work by the contractor.
