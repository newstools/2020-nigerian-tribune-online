A medical doctor, Dr Oyedeji Alagbe, has told a Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court in Lagos, how a driver, Ogbar, repeatedly defiled his 10-year-old daughter in their home. Dr Alagbe, who is a consultant at the Mirabel Centre (a sexual assault referral centre), has 14 years working experience at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, where he works at the Department of Family Medicine. While being led in evidence by the State Prosecutor, Mrs Arinola Momoh-Ayokanbi, the medical doctor told the court that he was before the court to interpret the child’s medical report, which was made by one Dr Olaniyi, who had examined the child but had since left the service of LASUTH. Dr Alagbe said the complainant on the day of the examination was accompanied to the Mirabel Centre by the mother of the victim and a female pastor. He said the victim had told Dr Olaniyi that she was defiled repeatedly by her father and that her younger brother had witnessed some of the sexual abuses.

He noted that the statements of the complainant’s mother and pastor corroborated the accounts of the child that she was repeatedly abused sexually by her father. While being cross-examined by the Defence Counsel, Mr Peter Odoeme, Dr Alagbe said the injuries on the hymen were consistent with those caused by forceful blunt penetration, which could be caused by penis. “The skilful methodology used by the doctor made the inference that the pattern of injuries found on the client was in tandem with the client’s verbal declaration that a penis was used,” he said. Following the cross-examination of the medical doctor, Momoh-Ayokanbi announced to the court that the prosecution was closing its case. The presiding judge, Justice Abiola Soladoye adjourned the case until March 24 for the father to open his defence. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
