A national youth-based group, Asiwaju Vanguard Campaign Group 2023, said it is poised to galvanise support for the presidential aspiration of the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. National Coordinator of the group, Mr Folarin Adekanbi, disclosed this on Thursday at a press parley held in Lagos, saying it was irrevocably set to galvanise political loyalists for the vision across the country, This was just as he appraised the contributions of the former Lagos State governor, Tinubu, describing him as a political icon, citing his unmatched qualities as a detribalised human capacity builder. Adekanbi said the group, with visible spreads in all the geopolitical zones of the country, would passionately influence the political view of Nigerians towards massively ensuring that Tinubu becomes the nation’s president come 2023.

Also, the group’s South-West National Coordinator, Hon. Femi Olowole (AKA Denmark), who also acknowledged the resourcefulness and proactive attributes of Tinubu, urged all to team up and ensure he becomes Nigeria’s next president. “He is a bridge-builder, a man that has compassion, a tested and trusted democrat, we believe that he is a man that has shown so much love to this country. “If anybody believes in the sovereignty of this country such can always come on board to be the president of this nation,” Oluwole said. The S/West coordinator, while maintaining that Tinubu’s presidency was not a dream but a reality, said it was the reason the group had resolved to mobilize extensively throughout all the geopolitical networks across the country to ensure that the APC national leader becomes the nation’s president, come 2023.
