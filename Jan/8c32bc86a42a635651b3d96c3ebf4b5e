ID Africa, owners of the NETng and producers of Nigerian Entertainment Conference (NECLive) have announced, at an exclusive media briefing today in Lagos, a new format for the eighth editions of the conference to be held on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. NECLive which is the premier and largest gathering of entertainment industry professionals in Nigeria will be expanding its format to accommodate new activities, events and programmes in order to deepen its impact and shore up its contributions to Nigeria’s entertainment and creative industry. For the past seven years, NECLive has run as an intensive full-day, nine-hour event featuring powerful panel sessions, insights from industry leaders and critically innovative conversations. Past editions of NECLive have seen over 12,000  attendees, reached over 60 million viewers online and via live TV, and hosted over 450 industry experts as speakers and panellists, including MI Abaga, 2Baba, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Simi, Davido, Bayo Adekanmbi, D’Banj, among others.

The theme for the event: “Building The Future”, explores various ways of maximising the potential and impact of recent strides in distribution, cinemas, events, promotions, exhibitions, productions and festivals, and how stakeholders can erect the infrastructure necessary to build the desired future for Nigeria’s creative and entertainment industry. With this new approach, #NECLive8 hopes to broach tougher conversations and nudge stakeholders towards extracting more value from the ecosystem than is currently obtainable. The expansion also allows for opportunities to introduce more experiential consumer activations and activities which will offer more value to attendees, creatives and brand partners. The two-day programme will now incorporate the standard elements of NECLive alongside new elements such as an awards dinner designed to celebrate the best of Nigerian entertainment, and a concert which will feature performances from across the spectrum of Nigeria’s entertainment industry. “Since the 2019 edition of NECLive, we have been working hard behind the scenes to redesign the entire NECLive experience. Our goal is to offer more value to all attendees, our brand partners, entertainment industry professionals, performers and creatives in Nigeria, and we believe the 2020 edition will deliver this objective,” says Femi Falodun, ID Africa CEO. Ayeni Adekunle, Founder and Convener of NECLive, also said, “We set up NECLive eight years ago as an intervention to rally everyone towards building the industry of our dreams. Eight years on, we are glad to witness and facilitate the transformation of our home entertainment, our music and our media. And we are calling on the government, practitioners, fans and investors to come to the party.” NECLive will hold at the Landmark Center, Lagos on Wednesday, April 22, 2020, from 10 am while the NECLive concert will take place at the same venue from 5 pm the same day.
