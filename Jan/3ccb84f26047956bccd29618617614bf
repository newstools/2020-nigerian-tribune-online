FOUR Emirs in Kano State including Emirs of Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya paid a visit to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje following the Supreme Court’s affirmation of his electoral victory. Recall that an election petition was filed against Ganduje’s victory at the polls by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its gubernatorial candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf. The petition was subsequently dismissed by the Supreme Court. Governor Ganduje during the Emirs’ visit to the Africa House, Government House, Kano, on Monday called on all the Emirs to help the government in securing the state and in other areas of health, environmental sanitation meant for the overall development of the state.
