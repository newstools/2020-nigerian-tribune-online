The Federal government has confirmed at least 41 people, including two doctors at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) to have died of Lassa fever in parts of the country since the beginning of 2020. The two doctors, Late Dr Habib Musa Muhammad, Consultant Anesthesiologist and a House Officer, Late Dr Ummukulthum Abba were reported dead after operating on a pregnant woman who was a primary carrier of the Lassa fever disease. The Honourable Minister of Health, Dr Ehanire made the disclosure on Tuesday during a press briefing at the ministry’s secretariat in Abuja said there were at least 258 confirmed cases recorded across 19 states in the country.
