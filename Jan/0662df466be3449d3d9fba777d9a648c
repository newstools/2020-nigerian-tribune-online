A former presidential spokesperson, Dr Doyin Okupe, has advised the Federal Government to see to the establishment of state police, as opposed to community police being contemplated by government. Okupe said shying away from creating state police “is a grand deception and a great disservice to the people.” He gave the advice in an open letter to the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, against the backdrop of the resolution of the controversy thrown up by the establishment of Operation Amotekun, a Western Nigeria Security Network initiative. The former spokesperson said the possibility of each state or region floating its own security initiative was high and called for state police rather than having a motley of state security outfits.

Instead of creating a motley web of mushroom, primitive and unstandardised local security outfits nationwide; it will be better if we take the bull by the horns. The truth is that time has come for the establishment of state police. “I am aware that the Federal Government is seriously considering the establishment of community policing. This project begs the question. It is unitary and therefore antithetical to the dictates of federalism. “When we have state police controlled by the state government, thereafter the states can embark on community policing by themselves at their convenience and on their varied terms. “For someone or groups of people to sit in Abuja, design and operate a community policing agenda is unacceptable and unworkable,” he said. He stressed that the country could only make progress when its leaders planned ahead and keep “away from primordial and primitive considerations and ever willing to divest themselves of powers and controls that will make society freer and safer.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
