Bicycles specially designed to be ridden on rivers, lakes and oceans have been launched in the United States and were displayed at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) held in Las Vegas during the week. The bicycles called The Hydrofoiler XE-1, were developed by Manta5, a company in New Zealand and according to its makers, they were designed to let people know that it is possible to ride a bike on the ocean. It also took them seven years to design. According to flipboard.com, the bike features hydrofoils in place of wheels, a propeller that lifts it out of the waters when the rider picks up speed and pedals to give it power.
