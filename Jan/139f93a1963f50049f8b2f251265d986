Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Bauchi on Friday marked its 10th years of establishment committing to provide improved tertiary and emergency medical services to the people of its catchment area. Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the celebration, Dr Jibrin Yusuf while addressing Journalists on Friday explained that the hospital was transformed from a Specialists Hospital into a Teaching Hospital in January 2010 following a request for such made to the Federal Government by the then Isa Yuguda led administration in the state. According to him, the mandates of the hospital are to provide standard tertiary healthcare services to the citizens of the state and other Nigerians, train students of medical sciences as well as to conduct researches on health issues. He also said that as part of the ATBUTH activities marking the event, special prayers were conducted in the hospital’s Friday mosque adding that similar prayers would be done in a Church on Sunday.

Aside from that, he said that outstanding serving and retired staff of the hospital would also be honoured on the award day slated for Monday. It would be recalled that during his tenure as Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda made a request to the President of Nigeria, Late Umar Musa Yar’Adua on the need to have another teaching hospital in the North-East zone considering that only the University of Maiduguri had a teaching hospital then. Though (ATBUTH) Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University was a technology-based institution, the Federal Government granted the request making it the only Federal University of Technology which has a teaching hospital in the country.
