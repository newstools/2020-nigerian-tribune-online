A Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos State, on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, sentenced Damilola Ahmed Adeyeri and his mother, Alaba Kareem Adeyeri to 12 years of imprisonment each for obtaining money under false pretence to the tune of $82, 570. 00, (Eighty-two thousand five hundred and seventy dollars). Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke convicted the son and mother following their plea of guilty to a four-count charge of conspiracy and obtaining money under false pretence preferred against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The convicts were arrested following a petition from the Federal Bureau of Investigation against Damilola Adeyeri and others now at large on an alleged case of conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretence, money laundering and computer-related fraud. EFCC counsel, Bilikisu Buhari, told the court that the mother and son conspired with one Kareem Russell, still at large, to defraud the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of American Cranes Manufacturing Company of $82, 570. 00.
