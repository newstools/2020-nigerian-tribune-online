The Managing Director, Unitop International Limited, Ahmed Mazloum admonished Nigerian youths to leverage on technological advancement in order to be a better candidate for any positions they long for. The Helmsman noted that technology is what dictates the world, especially Artificial Intelligence that is almost taking over, adding that skilling up ahead any change would engender better placement. The MD made this call during a media parley marking his 12 years tenure as the Managing Director of Unitop International Limited, held yesterday in Lagos. “My advice would go to the youths of this country. Yes, they are very energetic, industrious and aspiring. But, there is a need to adjust as life changes in order for one not to become obsolete. “The world is talking about technology and its entire components. Technology is taking over all businesses, transactions, and all other forms of endeavours. “Nigerian youths should not be left out in this change that technology is effecting. The world is also talking about Artificial Intelligence. So, the question is how are the youths getting prepared for this future that lies ahead of them.

Ahmed noted that this was the approach of leadership of developed countries resulting in the monumental developments in the states. “Leadership, especially transformational Leadership, is what has been driving so many advanced nations in the world because they look at the betterment of the populace first. “Transformational Leadership requires selfless goals and this is what I would indulge all Nigerian leaders be it in business, politics and other spheres that requires organisation. “Of course, to be selfless takes a lot from you but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel” Ahmed said.
