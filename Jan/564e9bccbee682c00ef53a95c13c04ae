He noted that tourism is a multifaceted sector consisting of both informal and formal enterprises, with numerous subcategories which include arts and crafts. “The activities of the arts and craft industry represent a special category of tourism (SMMEs). “Although the art and craft sector largely consists of an unskilled workforce and individuals from remote and poor rural areas, it contributes to addressing some of the challenges that local communities face. “It is also viewed as a cultural activity which represents the essence of the people’s way of life and serves as an integral part of the travel and tourism industry,” he said. The minister noted that with the impressive figures, the Creative Industry has been viewed as a sector that could help the government reach its goal of diversifying the nation’s economy away from oil.
