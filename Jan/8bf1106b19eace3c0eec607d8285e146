Chief Femi Falana (SAN) has been in the forefront of the fight for the enforcement of rights of Nigerian citizens when such rights are violated. He was arrested and detained by former military heads of state in Nigeria following his radicalism and insistence that their government must do the right thing and follow the rule of law. Some Nigerian leaders see Falana as their enemy due to his constructive criticisms. He is one of the bravest lawyers Nigeria has ever produced. I have been following the activities of Chief Falana since my days in primary school and he has not stopped fighting for the right of Nigerians until today. Falana remains a fearless legal luminary who is well respected both in Nigeria and the diaspora as a radical lawyer and great talent who has made a difference as a human rights activist. I want to use this medium to call on Barrister Muhammed Fawehinmi, the son of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, to join Chief Falana in the struggle to fight for the rights of Nigerians with rule of law. New Year: Lagos Speaker tasks newsmen on unity 2023: My hope to get Lagos working again ― Gbadamosi Demolition: Police denies involvement, group claims… Technology may fail operation ‘Amotekun’ in… The late Chief Gani Fawehinmi (SAN) struggled to liberate the masses throughout his lifetime; we all know that both Fawehinmi and Falana braved the odds to challenge the military dictatorship in Nigeria. I urge Barrister Fawehinmi and other learned members of the society to join Falana in the ongoing struggle to ensure the rule of law is followed in Nigeria. Though it is a big task and dangerous risk to fight for the right of Nigerians, we need more people to take up this battle.  Jimoh Mumin Esq. Ibadan.
