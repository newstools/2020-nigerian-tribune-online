The Adamawa State government under the administration of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has commenced the payment of bursary allowances to the students of tertiary institutions who are indigenes of the state. The over 26,000 students started benefitting from the scholarship scheme under the administration of Governor Fintiri, seven years after it was stopped. Making the disclosure today in Yola, National President of Adamawa State Students (NUADSS), Comrade Gaddafi Hussaini, announced that the union has been pushing for the payment of the scholarship in the last seven years, noting that their efforts only saw the light of the day during the Fintiri-led administration. He said the government has so far screened beneficiaries of the scheme following which payment commenced on January 22, 2020.

He noted that university students will receive N15,000 annually while their counterparts in polytechnic and colleges of education will N7,500 each annually. Hussaini appealed to students who are yet to receive the scholarship to be patient as the State Scholarship Trust Fund is working assiduously to ensure all students captured are paid. “My dear colleagues that are yet to receive payment as a result of bank’s network challenge should be patient as Adamawa State Scholarship Trust Fund will surely act on the matter and everyone will be paid the soonest. ”I will like to use this medium to thank and assure His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri that the Adamawa State students are 100 per cent in support of his administration,” he said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
