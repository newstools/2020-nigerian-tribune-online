The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has close down Panda Supermarket in the Jabi area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for illegally importing and selling expired products in Nigeria. Speaking with journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, the Director-General of the Commission, Mr. Babatunde Irukera said the Agency got information that there was a supermarket in the capital that was discriminating against other nationals.  “When that information was confirmed, we conducted a sting operation “he stated Upon conducting the sting operation, Irukera said at the front door of the supermarket (Panda), there was an inscription ‘Employers Only’ while inside the store, FCCPC found many products whose expiring date was 20 years from now, someone year while other had no expiring date at all. He said apart from these products not having any realistic expiring date, they also did not have any NAFDAC number “which means they do not pass through NAFDAC” he noted. Irukera lamented that the sale of contraband and expired food items is very disturbing especially at a time like this and especially when the products are coming from Asian countries.
