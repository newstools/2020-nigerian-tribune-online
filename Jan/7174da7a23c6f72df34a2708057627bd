He said the summit would be chaired by Chairman of Ndigbo Lagos, Prof. Anya O. Anya, while royal fathers of the day are Obi of Onitsha, His Royal Majesty, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe; Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III; Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi; Emir of Kano, His Royal Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II; Tor Tiv, His Royal Majesty, Prof. James Ayatse; Olu of Warri, His Royal Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli and Oba of Lagos, His Royal Highness, Oba Rilwan Akiolu. Speaking also, Utomi, Obieri, Anya and other speakers while commenting on the state of the nation, said Nigeria at present is drifting toward the same situation that brought about the Civil War, which lasted for about three years and therefore charged all stakeholders to do the needful by having a roundtable discussion to prevent what happened in Nigeria between 1966 and 1970. They said this is time for reflection in Nigeria, noting that the “Never Again Conference,” which is expected to be attended by government officials, traditional rulers, politicians and other key stakeholders will provide avenue for robust discussion and help in addressing what the country need to address to build bridges among all the ethnic groups in Nigeria. The speakers also disclosed that the “Never Again Conference” has nothing to do with the 2023 Igbo presidency agitation, nor the agitation of some groups in South-East demanding for Biafra.
