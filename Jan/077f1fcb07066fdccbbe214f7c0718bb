Similarly, data obtained from the financial statements of the commercial banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange showed that the deposits to the CBN were made between January and September 2019. Mandatory reserve deposit is not available for use in a bank’s day-to-day operations as it represents a percentage of the customers’ deposits and is non-interest bearing. The amount, which is based on qualified assets, is determined by the CBN from time to time and for the purpose of statement of cash flows and the balance is excluded from the cash and cash equivalents. Further analysis of the data showed that from Access Bank Plc, the CBN received N79.63 billion while N985.98 billion was recorded from Ecobank.
