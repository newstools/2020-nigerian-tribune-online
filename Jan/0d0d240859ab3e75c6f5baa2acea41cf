To further demonstrate  its commitment to empowering women, youths and building sustainable communities, The Coca-Cola Foundation has announced a grant worth $100,000 to the Mental and Environmental Development Initiative for Children (MEDIC), a non-governmental organisation,  that teaches young children about the importance of taking care of the environment. The grant, according to the Foundation, is aimed at assisting the organisation  towards implementing a Recycling Scheme for Women and Youth Empowerment (RESWAYE). Speaking on behalf of The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF), in Lagos, over the weekend, the Public Affairs, Communications and  Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Nigeria, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe noted that what  RESWAYE stands for, aligns with  two crucial passion points for the  Coca-Cola brand;  Women Empowerment and Sustainable Waste Management. “We recognize the importance of preserving our environment, and we are passionate about empowering women to reach their full potential. For this reason, we are excited to be partnering with MEDIC on this,” she stated. According to Nwamaka,  considerable amount of efforts is being put into female empowerment in Nigeria by The Coca Cola brand; since records have shown that there are twice as many women below the poverty line than men, and up to 19 times as many men in executive positions that women in Nigeria.

Speaking on the partnership, the Founder of MEDIC,  Doyinsola Ogunye, expressed the organisation’s delight to partner with the Foundation on the Recycling Scheme for Women and Youth Empowerment (RESWAYE). This, she stated, would go a long way in  tackling the 13th, 14th, and 15th of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which are, Climate Action, Life Underwater and Life on Land. “RESWAYE seeks to empower self-motivated women and young people who are ready to make a positive change in their environment. “The issue of waste management is one that concerns everyone in the society. People are encouraged to do as little as they can in ensuring the proper management of waste in their various communities. To this end, it is the belief of RESWAYE that Nigeria, and the world at large will be a better place if everyone does something little to help the community,” she added.
