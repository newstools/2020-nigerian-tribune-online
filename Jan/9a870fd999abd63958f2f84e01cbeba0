Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, made a surprise appearance at CMS Schools Complex in Bariga for an undiluted assessment of the ongoing capacity building programme for all public primary school teachers across the state. More than 2,000 teachers are currently undergoing the two-week intensive training being held under the state government’s Eko Excel Initiative. The programme is a key component of the Sanwo-Olu administration’s education blueprint seeking to deploy technology to fundamentally transform the basic education template, thereby improving the outcome of teaching and learning. The State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and its technical partner, Bridge International Academies, had already trained 2,400 primary school teachers in the first tranche of the capacity building programme.

The governor said his government had concluded the plans to digitise curriculum of basic schools, noting modern techniques were being employed to maximise learning in all public-owned primary schools. He said the teachers required the training to enable them to use gadgets being introduced by the government to achieve and measure academic growth in primary schools. He said: “We believe teachers are the first point of contact between the children and their future. The six hours spent with teachers can go a long way in shaping what the pupils will become tomorrow.” Apart from the training, Sanwo-Olu said the government would also be supporting the teachers with attractive welfare packages that would boost their morale and enhance productivity. To better motivate the teachers and get them committed to their duty, the governor disclosed that his administration would be introducing a vehicle scheme for headteachers to support them in delivering their responsibilities.
