Deputy Governor of Bauchi State, Sen Baba Tela, has declared that he is not a spare tyre in the governance of Bauchi State because the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended has assigned specific rules to him and his office as the deputy governor. The deputy governor who fielded questions from journalists in his country home in Azare said that, “how could you say that I am a spare tyre when I have many roles to play as contained in the constitution of the country?” He added, “even the spare tyre is very important, it has a role to play in a vehicle. If you doubt me, drive in the night and have a flat tyre in a bush that is about 100km away from the town where you are to get a vulcanizer then you will understand that a spare tyre is as good and important as the other tyres.” On his relationship with the governor, he said, “our relationship is very cordial, we relate as friends, brothers and distinguished senators. In fact, he gives me my due respect as a ranking senator because I was there before him. We are working together to make Bauchi State great again.” Abule-Egba explosion: Govt to meet with NNPC on compensation… APC guber candidate, Aliyu, commends INEC, security over… Kwara prosecutes 135 sanitation offenders Sokoto rerun election hitch-free, INEC says as declaration… ALSO READ: Abule-Egba explosion: Govt to meet with NNPC on compensation for victims ― Sanwo-Olu Baba Tela further said that, “we have come a long way together as friends and colleagues and from all indications we still have a very long way to go together Insha Allah.
