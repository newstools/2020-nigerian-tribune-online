“The pain is excruciating. At times my right leg to my hip will be so painful. At other times I experience severe pain on my right eye, nose, ear and my right arm and hand feel very heavy sometimes.I need about N2 Million for the next stage of the treatment. I have spent all I have. I am here by appealing to all well-meaning people, especially Nigerians, to please come to my aid.” This is the plea of 64-year old Madam Owabire Olukemi. According to her, it was while she was being treated for malaria in February of 2019 that the lump, which was later discovered to be cancerous, was first noted. After series of tests in different laboratories in Ibadan, she was advised to go to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan for confirmation. The test at the UCH confirmed that the right breast was indeed cancerous. In March 2019, she commenced treatment at the UCH and by June, her right breast was removed. She claimed to have spent over a million naira on treatment between February 2019 and now. She said the cost of treatment has eaten deep into her food canteen business. Now she needs to take six injections, each costing N309,853.00, and totaling N1,859,118. The Owo indigene of Ondo State said her doctor said she must take the injections at three weeks interval. If she takes one today, she will take the next after three weeks and the next after three weeks. In that order till she completes the dosage.

This is why I’m calling on the good people of Nigeria to please come to my aid.” She explained further that her husband, a retiree, who retired in 2011, was fortunate to collect his gratuity of N1million in 2019 and N600,000 of it was expended on her treatment at the UCH.

She said she had written a letter, seeking for assistance from UCH Medical Advisory Committee and also visited a pharmacy at the S.O.P. at UCH. But both explained to her that the amount she needs is huge and beyond what either the committee or the pharmacy could afford. She had also contacted the Breast Cancer Association of Nigeria (BRECAN) through this reporter. BRECAN, through her National President, said the association does more of awareness now and cannot assist financially as not many Nigerians respond to its appeal for donation. She, however, directed her to a medical practitioner at the UCH, who could counsel her. Madam Owabire, therefore called on the wives of governors, especially Her Excellencies, Mrs Betty Anyawu-Akeredolu; Mrs Omini Makinde; Mrs Bisi Fayemi; the Zonta Club and all other people who can assist her to please do so. She said she believes she would survive the ordeal if she gets funds for treatment!
