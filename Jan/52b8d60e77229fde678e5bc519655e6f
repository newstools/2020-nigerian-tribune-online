Senator Teslim Kolawole Folarin, representing Oyo Central in the National Assembly, has decried the Akesan market fire in Oyo State and called on the Commissioner of Police in the state to investigate alleged shooting of some people while the incident happened. Folarin, in a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen, said his call was predicated on what he said was “unconfirmed reports of shooting by the Security Forces, which may have caused the death of two people, while the fire raged.” The former Senate Leader also called on the Oyo State government to review its fire-fighting strategy, especially around markets and sundry public areas. He said “I urge the state government to urgently review the firefighting provisions across the state, particularly those around major markets. Eyewitnesses from Akesan confirmed that the State Fire Services/Station closest to the market had little or no water to tackle the blaze.” Appeal Court upholds ex-Lagos deputy speaker’s… 2023: Ten persons have shown interest to succeed me ― el… UPDATE: JAMB bows to pressure, suspends NIN for 2020 UTME… Unknown gunmen abduct Jigawa Assembly member’s wife While lamenting the inferno which destroyed the means of livelihood of hundreds of people, Folarin noted that “it is particularly saddening due to the fact that the Akesan fire happened just days after three children lost their lives in another fire incident at Molete area of Ibadan, also in Oyo State.” He said he had “notified officials of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Resources and Disaster Management of this incident. I would ensure that the Federal Government provides adequate relief and support items to those who have lost their livelihoods, properties and wares to the inferno. “We at the federal level and the state government must put aside partisan politics and fashion out how best to prevent future fire disasters like this. On rare occasions where there are fire incidents, we must ensure that there is adequate fire-fighting equipment and properly trained fire personnel, to tackle the blaze quickly and effectively.” He commiserated with the victims and said he would be cutting short his foreign trip for this reason.
