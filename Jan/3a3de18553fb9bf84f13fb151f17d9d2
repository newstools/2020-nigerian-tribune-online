As Nigeria makes move to reposition the agricultural sector towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production and attract investors in the sector, a stakeholder in the agricultural sector, Dr Abiso Kabir has advocated for favourable policies to drive export. Dr Kabir, who made this known on Monday in Abuja while speaking with journalists, said the inability to export most produce from Nigeria has been attributed to the inability of farmers to meet relevant international requirements on the health of plants that are meant for export, a development that is impeding foreign trade between Nigeria and other countries. The expert, who is also the Managing Director of Wal-wanne Group, explained that the challenges in the sector are daunting and one of such is the inability of farmers to efficiently export some of their produce.
