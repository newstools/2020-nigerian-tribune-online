In view of the need for information timeliness to mitigate the effect of disasters, the National Orientation Agency (NOA) and the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (MHDSD) are teaming up to coordinate the gathering of disaster information in Nigeria for prompt response. Director-General of NOA, Dr. Garba Abari made this known when the Disaster Management Department of the Ministry, led by its Director, Dr. Dorothy Nwodo paid him a working visit in his office. Dr. Abari stated that although disaster has become recurrent in recent times, timeliness of response to disaster makes all the difference; hence the importance of timely information in disaster management. This, he said, explains the appreciation of stakeholders, such as security and disaster management agencies, for the timely situation reports of NOA in matters of emergency.
