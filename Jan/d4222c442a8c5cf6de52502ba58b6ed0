We cannot continue doing things the usual way and expect the changes we want overnight. That’s why we want members of the public to know that all grievances emanating from development and physical planning can be objectively looked into without bias,” he said. The chairman disclosed that the committee, as part of its fact-finding function, would schedule periodic visits to some construction sites for on-the-spot assessment of claims by involved parties in any matter brought before it. “The Law establishing us empowers the committee to summon the parties involved in the complaint for further interrogation on a supposed infraction, either from an individual or on the part of the government or any of its officials,” the chairman explained. It would be recalled that the Physical Planning and Building Control Appeals Committee was constituted and inaugurated by Governor Sanwo-Olu in December 2019 to resolve misunderstandings emanating from physical planning and urban development matters.
