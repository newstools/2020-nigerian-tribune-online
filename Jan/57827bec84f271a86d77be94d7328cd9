The accident led to the burning of the vehicle as the two people, the driver and the truck boy were burnt beyond recognition. Meanwhile, members of the Federal Road Safety Corps were on hand to control the traffic and also evacuate the cement bags that littered the road to avoid another accident. The Firefighters were not left out as they put off the fire to also avoid further explosion since the scene of the accident is very close to some Petrol stations.
