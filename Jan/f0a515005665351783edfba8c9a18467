The Chairman of the SouthWest Governors’ Forum and the Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday, said the Western Nigeria Security Network codename Amotekun has come to stay irrespective of criticism from any part of the country. Speaking through his Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Mr Ojo Oyewamide, Akeredolu while reacting to the statement made by the National Secretary, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Saleh Alhassan, said all legal means would be deployed to ensure the success of the security outfit in the region. Akeredolu however, maintained that the security outfit would operate within the region without necessarily affecting the oneness of the country as a nation. The governor who ignored the outburst of the Miyetti Allah scribe, and restrained from attacking Alhassan over his comments, said “as usual, the issue was Amotekun. Rather than throwing same stones, the arrogant miscreant threw at the governors, we will rather put the blame on those internal collaborators whose parochial political pursuits have beclouded their sense of tomorrow.
