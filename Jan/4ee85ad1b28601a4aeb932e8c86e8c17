As the All Progressives Congress (APC) inaugurated its renewed gubernatorial mandate in Kogi State, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Musa Wada, has described the victory of the ruling party at the November 16 poll as temporal. He said because the All Progressives Congress was running with a stolen mandate, instead of celebration in Lokoja the state capital and all other parts of Kogi State, the confluence city has been enveloped in gloom. Engr Wada said this, in Abuja, when he paid a visit to the family of the slain PDP women leader, Salome Abuh, murdered by political thugs alleged to be sympathetic to the ruling APC in Kogi. According to him, the mandate being claimed by APC in Kogi state is like a stolen car which cannot be used in then open particularly in the area where it was stolen.
