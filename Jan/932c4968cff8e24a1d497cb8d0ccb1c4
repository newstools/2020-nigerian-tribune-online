It was a delightsome scene last Thursday when the entire members and well-wishers of Celestial Church of Christ, Eleyele Cathedral, Ibadan, Oyo State, converge on the church auditorium to commemorate the 50th anniversary celebration of the church. According to the patron of the church, John Iwolode, the ceremony, which witnessed the attendance of key personalities within the celestial fold in Oyo State and beyond, was a time to appreciate God for his kindness that had made the church weathered several storms in the past 50 years. In his sermon at the programme, the spiritual head of CCC Worldwide, Reverend E.M.F Oshoffa, represented by the international representative, Most Superior  Evangelist Deji Nunayon, congratulated the shepherd and the entire elders of the church on the success of the anniversary.
