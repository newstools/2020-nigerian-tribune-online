The presidency, on Wednesday, reminded the nation that the tragedies of the Nigerian civil war were caused by what it called aggressive regionalism, ethnic baiting and political corruption. In a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Garba Shehu, to mark the 50th year of the end of the war, it maintained that despite the consequences of the war some people were repeating the mistakes and making inflammatory rhetorics. The statement read: “As the nation commentates 50 years of the end of the nation’s tragic civil war today, we remember the victims of the conflict and honour those on both sides that lost their lives. Their tragedy shall be neither forgotten nor repeated.
