Lagos State government, on Monday, announced plans to commence total enforcement of the 2012 State Traffic Law on activities of motorcyclists, popularly called Okada and tricycles, called “Keke Marwa” on restricted routes and bridges, come February 1, 2020. The State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, said this at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, at a joint press briefing with the Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde and his counterpart in Justice Ministry, Moyosore Onigbanjo. Omotoso said the enforcement would be carried out in six local government and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) as a pilot scheme before the enforcement would be extended to other council areas in the state. According to him, restriction and enforcement also affect the newly introduced ‘Opay ride,’ ‘Gokada ride’ and other similar commercial motorcycles.

Omotoso listed the affected local governments and LCDAs to include: Apapa LG and Apapa Iganmu LCDA, Lagos Mainland LG and Yaba LCDA, Surulere LG, Itire-Ikate and Coker-Aguda LCDAs, Ikeja LG, Onigbongbo and Ojodu LCDAs, Eti-Osa LG, Ikoyi-Obalende and Iru/Victoria Island LCDAs, Lagos Island LG and Lagos Island East LCDA. The commissioner said the measure became necessary following flagrant disregards to the traffic law by the operators and moreso, the need to further ensure the safety of lives and property of residents and members of the public in general. Omotoso, who decried the rate of accidents arising from the operation of Okada and tricycles in the state, described the figure as scary, disclosing that from 2016 to 2019, there were over 10,000 accidents recorded at the General Hospitals alone. He said the figure, however, did not include unreported cases and those recorded by other hospitals, pointing out that the total number of deaths from reported cases was over 600 as at date.
