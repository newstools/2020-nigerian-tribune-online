The minister made the call while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of a wedding ceremony at the Nigerian Air Force Protestant Church, Sam Ethnan Air Force Base, Ikeja, Lagos. He said that Nigerians needed to know that the change they wanted to see in the government should begin from individual homes. “We quite appreciate the aspirations of Nigerians and the government remains focused and determined to ensure that all the promises regarding the economy and creating more jobs will come through. “We also need the support of Nigerians. They should appreciate the fact that there is no magic that can be done to turn around any economy at the speed they are demanding. “Everybody must play his or her own role by being patriotic and making sure we do not incite violence against ourselves or the government. 608 repentant Boko Haram members currently undergoing… Malami’s statement on Amotekun is faulty, Olugbon… Barack Obama eulogises wife as she turns 56 Lagosians express concerns following NAFDAC’s alert on use… ALSO READ: Malami’s statement on Amotekun is faulty, Olugbon cautions FG “Nigeria consists of multicultural and multi-religious groups.

Embrace punctuality, honesty and unity. We are going to enforce that campaign this time around. “We will get it on air, as we are also looking for sponsors because until that change is internalised, the government can do but little,” he said.
