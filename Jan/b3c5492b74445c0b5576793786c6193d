Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has solicited the cooperation of development partners and other stakeholders in transforming the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector in the state. Ugwuanyi made the call in Enugu, on Thursday, while inaugurating an 18-man Inter-ministerial Committee on the Implementation of WASH Action Plan in the state. The governor said the government had declared a state of emergency on WASH sector in the state to ensure healthy living. Ugwuanyi, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Simon Ortuanya, said that the WASH sector had not received the needed attention in the country which had thrown up several challenges to citizens. The governor said that the state government was committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) six to ensure the provision of clean water and improve sanitation. He said that the government had already made some move to enhance sanitation by approving the construction of abattoirs across major markets in the state. The governor also said that the state government had equally approved the construction of public toilets in major markets.
