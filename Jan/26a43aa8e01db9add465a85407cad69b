Abideen Olasupo, executive director, Brain Builders International (BBI), a non-governmental organisation, is the only Nigerian among the 12 global ambassadors for Youth Power Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) campaign initiative. The initiative, organised by Restless Development, UK, seeks to bring youth activists together to call for support in achieving the SDGs. Other ambassadors of the initiative are from the US, Mexico, Philippines, UK, Lebanon, Kenya, Ghana, France, India, Cameroon and Barbados. In a statement, organisers of the initiative said the campaign was borne out of the need to accelerate the achievement of the global goals or SDGs, adopted by the United Nations in 2015. “We have made progress but nowhere near enough. We are running out of time. Young people stand ready, and united, to take the lead in making the Global Goals a reality,” the statement read. “As the youth-led climate strikes have shown, collective action from young people is already changing things for the better. Young people are fighting FOR fairness, justice, and the environment. They are fighting AGAINST inequality, persecution and climate change.
