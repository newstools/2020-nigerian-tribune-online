The BASPHCDA boss said, “The last time we told you that we had 15 suspected cases but as at now, the suspected cases have increased to 22. I also told you last time that we had three confirmed cases, four new cases have been added bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state to seven”.

We have two more suspected cases in Giade Local Government and one in Azare, Katagum LGA. We are planning on what to do with Azare because it is close to Kano state and since there is an outbreak there (in Kano), we are now afraid,”. Rilwanu Mohammed added that” there was a suspected case that was brought there from Giade and the patient was bleeding, so they were confused. We in Bauchi are not panicking, we are trained and this is not new to us in the state, so we know what to do.” He said that Bauchi State has been helping states like Gombe, Plateau, Kano, on what to do with the new cases in their states and warned that, “all Lassa fever cases should be transported in an ambulance and not in a commercial car because it can be transmitted to those in the vehicle.” Rilwanu Mohammed also said that the Agency will soon embark on an aggressive campaign through radio and television jingles and other media to sensitise the public on all preventive measures that they need to undertake to stay safe and prevent the disease from spreading. He then called on members of the general public not to put emphasis only on rats to human transmission saying that although it (rat) is that initial infection transmitter “most of the infections you get today are not from rats but from human to human and contact with an infected person must be prevented.” It will be recalled that last week, three cases of the Lassa fever was confirmed and were said to be receiving treatment at the isolation centre of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital in Bauchi while other suspected victims were placed on observation.
