It was jubilation galore in Makurdi, the Benue State capital as supporters of Governor Samuel Ortom danced round major streets to celebrate the judgment of Supreme Court. Many people including party faithful, market women and youths were seen at various streets of Makurdi jubilating. Meanwhile, prominent sons of the state have congratulated the governor on the victory at the apex court. Two former presidents of the Senate, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and Senator David Mark, as well as former ministers of interior, Abba Moro, and state for education, Professor Jerry Agada, lauded the judgment of the court. Mark said that the affirmation is a validation of the mandate given to Ortom by the people of Benue State. According to the statement issued by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, said, “the validation of your mandate by SCN is an affirmation of the trust reposed in you by the people of Benue State to serve them; for their development, welfare and security which must not be taken for granted.” He urged the governor to be magnanimous in victory by extending hands of fellowship to his major opponent, Emmanuel Jime, and his supporters in the task of working for the good of Benue people and also implored him to join Ortom in the voyage to develop the state. In his own reaction, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, said the affirmation of Governor Samuel Ortom’s election by the Supreme Court today was not surprising because he, Ortom, won overwhelmingly in the first election and in the rerun. Ayu who spoke to newsmen on phone said except for the case of Imo State, the Supreme Court would have performed excellently and observed that on the whole, the apex court has done well.

He congratulated Ortom on the victory and urged him to follow the recommendations made by the transition committee which he headed. On his part, former minister of State for Education Professor Jerry Agada described Ortom’s victory at the Supreme Court as a true reflection of Benue electorate’s decision at the last general elections. “As an elder statesman, I expected nothing less but a victory for our amiable governor having been victorious from both the election Tribunal and Appeal Courts and now reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.” Prof Agada called on all in the state to support Ortom’s administration to deliver the dividends of democracy to her citizenry. Also former minister of interior now senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, Abba Moro, congratulated Governor Ortom on his victory at the Supreme Court. Senator Moro said that the court’s verdict has no doubt laid to rest the unnecessary dust stirred by the opposition over the mandate reposed on Governor Ortom by the people of Benue State during the last governorship election. The senator also lauded the judiciary for a sound Judgment, which has ended the needless legal tussle over the victory of the PDP at the polls. He reiterated his stand to continue to work with Governor Ortom and other political leaders to take Benue State to greater heights. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
