Child prodigy and 12-year-old author, Munachi Mbonu, a student of Atlantic Hall, Lagos, has received accolades on the publication of her third book titled ‘Father’s Will’. ‘Father’s Will’ is a fantasy interwoven with science fiction, in which the main character, a super cop, demonstrates innate powers to solve earth-shattering cases. Munachi had previously authored two books: ‘Concealed’ and ‘Chidubem’. Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, was among distinguished personalities at the unveiling ceremony. The governor, who was visibly impressed, praised the teenage author and encouraged her not to relent in her efforts. “Munachi is no doubt on a path to greatness. She has defined her path and I must say without a doubt that the sky is her limit,” the governor said. The Chairman of Atlantic Hall Educational Trust Council, Mrs. Taiwo Taiwo, expressed profound pride in Munachi, describing her as an embodiment of the school’s mission to raise critical thinkers and best talents for the 21st century.

Crime will reduce drastically as young ones become more purposeful and aim for their personal growth,” Kyari noted. School principal, Andrew Jedras, reaffirmed the school’s determination to consolidate on its track record of excellence. “We have aligned our strategic thinking, planning and direction to ensure that the education that students receive at Atlantic Hall reflects our transformative approach; one that is more than knowledge acquisition, but which at its core is committed to creating a crop of top-flight young people fit for a global 21st century,” said Jedras.
