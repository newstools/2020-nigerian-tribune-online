Anambra State government has cautioned its citizenry to restrict their travels to Wuhan in China due to the contagious nature of the disease coronavirus. Anambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C.Don Adinuba, in a statement said, “the Coronavirus may have started in Wuhan, China, but it is a clear and present danger to the international community, including Anambra State.” Adinuba said that the Anambra State government decided on this travel advisory to its people, given that people from the state are reputed as the most travelled Nigerians, if not Africans. He said avoiding the city of Wuhan, China, for now, despite its allure as an industrial and transportation hub is important to ensure they do not contract the virus.
