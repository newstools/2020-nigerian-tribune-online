Maina is being prosecuted by the EFCC on a 12-count charge, bordering on operating fictitious bank accounts, fraud and money laundering to the tune of over N2 billion, alongside his son, Faisal, who is facing a three-count charge of money laundering, corruption and lack of full disclosure of assets. Though he was granted bail on November 25, 2019, Maina has remained in Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja due to his failure to meet up with his bail conditions.  Maina was on November 25, 2019 granted bail in the sum of N1 billion and two sureties.
