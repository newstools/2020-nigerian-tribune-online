Ogunbiyi tendered her resignation back on October 7 after securing a top United Nations appointment, giving the mandatory three months’ notice in preparation to hand over to her successor and transition REA to its new leadership. Her resignation letter was addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari through the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Minister of Power, Minister of State for Power, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Power, and the Chairman of the REA board were copied.
