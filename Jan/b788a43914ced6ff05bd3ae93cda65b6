He further explained that “this afternoon some parts of the market got burnt. As we have gathered, the fire started from a refuse dump site across the fence of the market. “The fire started when some gang of Marijuana smokers that have turned the dumpsite to their den dropped the leftover of what they were smoking on the refuse and walked away. “The fire started slowly and because that part of the fence of the market is too low, the fire gained access into a shop where plastic disposable plates were stored. “And from there the fire razed about ten buildings to the ground and partially burning several others, leaving goods worth millions of Naira destroyed. “Although no lives were lost several persons sustained various degrees of injuries while they were attempting to take their goods to safety. “If not for the quick intervention of the State Fire Service, more shops would have been burnt down. This is not the first time this is happening and we have reported the matter to the state government that collects revenue every day but they have refused to do anything about it.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
