Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has called for equal partnership between the United Kingdom and African countries if it hoped to have genuine global development. Governor Sanwo-Olu made the call while speaking to journalists at the sideline of the UK-Africa Investment Summit that opened in London on Monday, just as he reaffirmed the resolve of his administration to bring new opportunities that would improve the lives of Lagosians. The UK-Africa Investment Summit is attended by African leaders, international business chief executives and heads of international organisations with the aim of creating new partnerships that will deliver more investments and jobs to the benefit of people and businesses in African countries and the United Kingdom. Governor Sanwo-Olu, at the Summit, joined President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo for meetings on trade and investment.

So for me, those points truly suggest that we can begin to see true partnership come out of conversations like this. “For us, it is to see what type of giver you are, are you seeing us as equal partners or master to servant relationship? At the end of the day, what we will be seeking to achieve is what is the greatest good for the greatest number. What are those additional benefits that we see and believe that have potentials to improve the lives of our people?” Speaking further, Governor Sanwo-Olu also noted that the forum, UK-Africa Investment Summit, is a major opportunity for Africans, most of all Lagos, stating that if the summit was not properly tapped, it could be transferred somewhere else. He assured that the state government was open for transactions that would make Lagos better, emphasising on the importance of time. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
