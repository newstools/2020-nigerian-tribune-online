The minister added that producing methanol from natural gas would significantly increase gas utilisation and consequently reduce gas flaring in the country. ‘’Methanol production would help to grow the chemical industry and provide clean energy for cooking and also serve as a replacement for diesel,” he said. Dr Onu, therefore, urged stakeholders in the SouthEast to embrace the innovation and collaborate with the Federal Government to ensure the full implementation of the policy.
