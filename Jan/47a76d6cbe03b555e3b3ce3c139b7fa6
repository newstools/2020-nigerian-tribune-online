United States President Donald Trump on Monday morning defended his decision to kill Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, contending Soleimani posed an impending threat to the United States but also saying that was not important given the military leader’s history. “The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was ‘imminent’ or not, & was my team in agreement.” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The answer to both is a strong YES, but it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!” ALSO READ: Ondo public school pupils lament suspension of free transportation Since confirming that Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani had been killed by a US airstrike in Baghdad, administration officials have claimed they acted because of an imminent risk of attacks on American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. Iran agrees de-escalation ‘only solution’ to… Soleimani assassination: Trump, Defence secretary’s… At UN, US justifies killing Iranian commander Soleimani as… ‘We’re going to war, bro’, US soldiers… Democrats and a few Republicans in Congress have questioned the justification of the attacks and said they have not been given adequate, detailed briefings. Last week Trump posited in an interview that Iran had been poised to attack four American embassies before Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike on Jan. 3. But on Sunday US Defence Secretary said he did not see specific evidence that Iran was planning an attack. “What the president said was that there probably could be additional attacks against embassies. I shared that view,” Esper said. “The president didn’t cite a specific piece of evidence.” When pressed on whether intelligence officers offered concrete evidence on that point, Esper said: “I didn’t see one with regards to four embassies.” REUTERS STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
