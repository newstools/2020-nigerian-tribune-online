Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), on Monday, took to the street of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja to protest the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and his aides in a drone airstrike by the United States, burning American flags at the Banex, Wuse area of the territory. The demonstrators, who condemned the US’s action, however, shouted ‘Death To America,’ and demanded the immediate release of their leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat who have been incarcerated since December 2015. It was also gathered that some Muslim youths barricaded Abuja-Keffi road in protest against Soleimani’s killing resulting in serious artificial hindrances on the ever-busy federal road. They also brought commercial activities in the Mararaba and Nyanya axis of the Federal Capital Territory down, as traders who feared an escalation of their action locked up their shops and ran away.
