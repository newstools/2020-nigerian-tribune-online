The Chairman, Nigerian Legion, Ondo State Command, Col. Olu Apata, on Friday, urged the Federal Government not to discourage the initiative of the southwest governors in securing the lives or the property of the people of the region through the creation of the Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed Operation “Amotekun”. Apata who stated this in an interview with TribuneOnline, urged the Federal government to embrace the idea, saying the security outfit was established to complement the efforts of the security agencies in combating crimes in the region. He frowned over the Federal Government declaration that the security outfit was illegal as it shows government insensitivity to the security of lives and property.

He said “the initiative is a welcome development, considering the insecurity in our land especially the southwest region. “The initiative is a laudable one and the governor should be commended for coming up with this idea at this critical period. “The Federal government should not see this as illegal as it does not affect the security agencies but should be seen as an effort to complement the efforts of the security agencies. “Federal government should not see this as a threat to the nation’s security but we will appeal to them to study the concept and support the governors on this beautiful initiative” STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
