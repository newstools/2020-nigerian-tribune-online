Governments at all levels have been advised to concentrate on empowerment programmes among indigent women to ensure effective poverty reduction in society. Speaking during an event to appreciate loyal beneficiaries of an empowerment loan package of a non-governmental organisation in Ilorin, Kwara state, Gobir organisation foundation, founder of the NGO, Alhaji Yakubu Gobir, said effects of poverty on women are greater in our society. “Most of our women who are gainfully engaged in one business venture or the other ensure that their homes are catered for and this would in no time reflect on the socio-economic well being of other members of the family which on a larger scale would transform to better society”, he said.

About N15 million has been disbursed so far in other tranches. Automatically, those that have completed payment of N10,000, who we are celebrating today, have qualified for N20,000 loan. Those with N20,000 before can now take N30,000 etc”, he said. Alhaji Gobir, who was represented at the event by the coordinator of the programme, Hon. Bolujoko George said that the aim of the foundation amongst other things is to alleviate poverty, which he said had become a major issue of concern in both the state and the nation. “The fund is set aside to provide easy access to interest-free microloans to indigenes of Asa, Ilorin East, Ilorin West and Ilorin South Local Government Areas with the aim of providing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with capital for growth”, he said. He also said that the money disbursed to the indigent women ranged between N10,000 and N50,000 depending on the assessment of needs of beneficiaries, adding that training on basic financial intelligence and entrepreneurship was given to beneficiaries. Beneficiaries of the N10,000 loan who had paid back were presented such items like yards of Ankara textile material and umbrella, while they are also privileged to take a higher loan.
