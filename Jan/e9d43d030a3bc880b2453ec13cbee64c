The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the Supreme Court for upholding the wishes of the people who voted for Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi, Samuel Ortom of Benue and Ahmed Fintiri of Adamawa State. But the main opposition party insisted the judgment on Imo State which voided the election of Emeka Ihedioha as governor must be reviewed and reversed. In a statement issued by Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary in Abuja on Tuesday, the party maintained that its governors won the elections in their respective states and any disposition to the contrary would have further diminished the hard-earned image of the highest court of the land as Nigerians know that the PDP won in those states.

The party noted that by upholding the Sokoto, Bauchi, Benue and Adamawa elections, the Supreme Court has shown that it can still be trusted to assert its independence and can further redeem its image by immediately reversing its defective and widely condemned judgment on Imo state.

It added: “This is because the miscarriage of justice in the Imo judgment is glaring, given the established fact that the Supreme Court conjured strange figures as votes and donated same to the APC and its candidate, Senator Hope Uzodimma, and used the unfounded figure as basis to declare a party that came fourth as winner of the election. “What is most embarrassing is that in allocating the conjured figures to the APC, the Supreme Court became caught in a web, as a total number of votes suddenly jumped to 950,952, over and above INEC’s 823, 743 official number of accredited voters for the election.” The PDP, therefore, insisted that only a judicial review will guarantee justice in this matter as the PDP, the people of Imo State and Nigerians at large are not ready to allow the Supreme Court to impose a governor other than the person elected by the people at the poll. In congratulating Governors Tambuwal, Ortom, Fintiri and Bala Mohammed, the party urged them to continue in the path of good governance for which they were elected, in line with the manifesto and vision of the PDP. It also called on all PDP elected and appointed officials as well as members, teeming supporters and Nigerians across the board to continue the demand for a judicial review on Imo, adding that the PDP will continue to toe that path until justice is seen to have been done.
