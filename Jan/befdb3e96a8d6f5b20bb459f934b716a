Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has directed that the new minimum wage of N30,000 be paid to the state civil servants from January 2020. He also ordered for the immediate verification of personnel to possibly weed out ghost workers on the payroll. The governor gave the directives when he received the report of the committee constituted by the state government on implementation of the new minimum wage and consequential adjustments. ”Verification of unscheduled staff and the sharp practise of the sale of offer letters of employment to unwary citizens and a situation where children are on the payroll of the government will not be condoned. ”Prior to the negotiation that ushered the new wage regime, the state government had discovered a disparity in the salary data between the state civil service commission, the ministry of finance and the office of the head of service.
