Farmers in Ondo State under the auspices of Ondo State Agricultural Commodities Association (OSACA) have described the declaration of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubarka Malami on the security outfit recently inaugurated by Southwest governors (Amotekun) as inhumane and illegal. Addressing newsmen in Akure, the farmers stated that the position of the Attorney General was unacceptable to them. They described Amotekun as a ray of hope to rescue them from the heinous activities of herdsmen who have been destroying their farms and raping their women without restraint. According to the address read by the Chairman of the association, Mr. Gbenga Obaweya, the security outfit jointly set up by the Southwest governors would help ameliorate the economic loss they suffered annually from the Fulani herdsmen who grazed on their crops. “We say in clear terms that the declaration of Amotekun as an illegality is totally unacceptable to us. The formation and launch of Amotekun brought a ray of hope to us as farmers and agropreneurs for a few days, but alas , an attempt is bring made to dash all our hope. “For years we have sought peaceful means of protecting our farmlands and investments with very little success. Any attempt to shoot down this beacon of hope is a recipe for chaos and civil unrest. “Will the pauperized farmer, distressed investor not be pushed to violence if they believe they have nobody to protect them?” Nigeria’s security forces underpaid, overstretched ― Atiku Amotekun: Osinbajo, South-West govs, security officials may… Abdulsalami Abubakar calls for synergy among Nigerians to… Lassa fever: Pregnant woman, two doctors feared dead at… They, however, resolved that “We support the security outfit, Amotekun; we reject any proclamation that it is illegal; we demand that the national body of Miyetti Allah be called to order; farmers who have been victims should be compensated.” The group, therefore, called on “Ondo State government through the state House of Assembly, to pass the proposed bill on regulation of grazing activities that has been before them since 2018.” Some of the farmers who spoke with newsmen thereafter shared their terrible experiences in the hands of the herdsmen. Mr. Shado Evans revealed that he’s a frustrated farmer having lost all his palm tree plantation to herdsmen who grazed on the farm at night. He explained that he has run bankrupt as he could not pay back loans he got from bank which he invested in the 10 hectares Palm plantation. Another farmer, Pastor Olayinka Olabiran explained that his Palm tree plantation and plantain worth over N4 Million was destroyed by Fulani herdsmen last year November and the military and Civil Defence officials assisted in arresting four among the herdsmen. He was offered N300, 000 compensation by the herdsmen, wondering how he’s going to pay the bank loan. They all declared that Amotekun has come to stay, urging the Southwest governors to ignore the Attorney General. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
