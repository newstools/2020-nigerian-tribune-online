The Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed “Amotekun” was on Thursday launched with governors of the six states of the South West giving clarifications on the rationale behind the setting up of the outfit. Resonating in the speeches of the governors is that the outfit was only established in embracing community policing and complementing the efforts of traditional security outfits like the police and army. They explained that the outfit was not an alternative to the police force but established to assist the nation’s security infrastructure through intelligence gathering and to forge a common front to ensure peaceful coexistence in the zone. Present at the launch were Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo); deputy governors Benedict Alabi (Osun), Noimot Salako-Oyedele (Ogun). Others are the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi; leader, Yoruba World Congress, Professor Banji Akintoye; the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams represented by Osi Are of Yorubaland, Kayode Balogun; Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr Sunday Dare. UPDATE: South West govs give clarifications as Amotekun is… Amotekun will not participate in any political activities ―… South-West should support Amotekun ― Ooni of Ife No going back on Amotekun security outfit ― Olugbon Speaking on purportedly being summoned before the launch of the outfit launch, Akeredolu said President Muhammadu Buhari never summoned the South-West governors on the outfit. He said the governors only had a formal discussion with the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, in which they were represented by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state.

All that happened is that we needed to have formal discussion with the Inspector General of Police and we did not all have to go there. The governor of Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi represented us there and had formal discussion with the IGP and that is all. The President never summoned us on this matter at all. “The essence of Amotekun is collaboration. We are not here to upstage any of the security operatives that we have on ground, be it military, police, civil defence. We are all going to work together. Even the personnel that will work, I can tell you about Ondo state, we had all sat down to discuss with the brigade commander, commissioner of police, because when it comes to security, not one outfit can do it alone. There must be synergy and we must all come together to work and together,” Akeredolu said.
