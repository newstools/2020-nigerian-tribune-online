The presidency has reacted angrily to the call by Senate Minority Leader, Eyinnaya Abaribe, for President Muhammadu Buhari to resign over growing insecurity in the country. A statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President Media &Publicity said it is the senator that should resign because he enabled the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu to escape justice. The statement read: “President Buhari to resign on what basis? Just because some characters think that President Buhari should resign, then they expect him to quit. That call does not represent the opinion of the country. This is the opinion of an armchair critic, known for making stray comments.

Senator Abaribe has failed repeated deadlines to return Kanu to the court for trial, yet he has the effrontery with which to accuse someone of failing to the bidding of the law. “This is a man who should have replaced the suspects he failed to produce in the correctional facility. Abaribe’s party raped the nation and left it collapsing in 2015 and President Buhari is fixing things up all the years he has been in office. “President Buhari is working hard to keep Nigeria and Nigerians out of the harm terrorists have unleashed in the entire Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa. With the support of Nigerians and our foreign friends, he is going to finish off these terrorists. He alone can do it.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
