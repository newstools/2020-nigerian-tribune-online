The Magistrate Court in Oke Eda in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Friday resumed the trial of the founder of Sotitobire Miracle Centre, Prophet Babatunde Alfa, over the disappearance of a one-year-old toddler, Gold Kolawole, in his church during service. However, journalists covering the court proceedings were ordered out of the court by the presiding judge, Magistrate Charity Adeyanju. The already seated journalists were ordered out of the courtroom some few minutes before the commencement of the trial, with the police prosecutor, Inspector Uloh Goodluck, ordering journalists to vacate their seats without any cogent reason. The police prosecutor who was queried by the newsmen was said to have stormed out of the courtroom threatening that the proceedings will not hold until the newsmen leave the court.

The Prophet was charged alongside six others on six counts of felony, conspiracy, and kidnapping.
