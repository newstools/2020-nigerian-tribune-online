Youths in Ogun State have lauded Governor Dapo Abiodun over the constitution of transition committees and appointment of committee members for the twenty local governments in the state. The youth under the aegis of APC Youth League, in a statement signed by its coordinator, Olamide Lawal, said those appointed were party men who have sacrificed for the party, assuring that those appointed will perform well. The statement reads in part: “A critical look at the list indicated that everyone who made up the five-member committee in the 20 local governments of the state, are truly party men and women whose loyalty and zeal to work cannot be questioned. “We sincerely appreciate Mr Governor for choosing one of us, our immediate past South West Secretary, Honourable Emmanuel Olumuyiwa Babayemi as chairman of the Committee in Ewekoro Local government council. This is a show of great trust and love for our group (All Progressive Congress Youth League, Ogun State chapter).” Gas explosion: Kaduna govt condoles families of victims Many feared dead as explosion hits Kaduna How we killed final year female LASU student, suspects give… Sanwo-Olu urges Muslims to practice peace with people in… ALSO READ: How we killed final year female LASU student, suspects give gory details as police exhume corpse Meanwhile, the Director Administration and Supplies in the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Adetunji Kanimodo, lauded the state government for investing greatly to the development of sport in the state. Kanimodo who spoke at the sent-forth ceremony organised in honour of the former Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Peter Fagbohun, listed some of the achievements to include the successful hosting of the Ultra Race in Sagamu and the 10km race in Abeokuta which opened up all the stadia to gain more attention. He noted that the recent procurements, installations and renovations in the ministry including that of the Dipo Dina Stadium in Ijebu Ode were possible through the efforts of the outgoing permanent secretary who brought improvement to the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the Ministry and the moral and financial support of the government. Kanimodo further charged members of staff to extend the same hand of fellowship to the new permanent secretary, Engr. Olayiwola Abiodun, to further develop the state civil service.
