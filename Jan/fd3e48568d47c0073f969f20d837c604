Oyo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused Abubakar Mallami, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), dabbling into internal affairs of Oyo State. This claim was made in a press release signed by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Engr. Akeem Olatunji. The party said it was wrong for the AGF to order the state Governor to return the dissolved local government chairmen in the state. PDP advised that rather than Malami, poking his nose into the state’s affairs, he should be more concerned about the Federal Government’s various disregards of the judiciary’s pronouncements and lack of respect for the rule of law. “Rather than poking his nose into the internal affairs of Oyo State, Mr Abubakar Malami should be more concerned about the Federal Government’s various disregard of judiciary’s pronouncements and lack of respect for the rule of law,” the statement read.

The party reiterated that it is nobody’s fault the Nigerian Constitution put the control, legislation, and supervision of the local governments under the supervision of the state. The party further accused the APC and the AGF of trying to pursue its 2023 political agenda to stop federal allocations meant for the state, which it said was similar to what former Attorney General, Akin Olujimi, SAN, did to stop Federal allocations meant for Lagos State through executive fiat. PDP further said that Nigeria practices federalism and not a unitary system of government as the need for separation of power is necessary to avoid actions that can jeopardise the image of Nigeria within the Comity of Nations. Oyo State PDP, however, advised the APC in Oyo State to “look for their saviour elsewhere” as it claimed “the AGF is not constitutionally empowered” to assist them in foisting illegality on the good people of Oyo State. Caretaker chairmen across the 33 Local Councils and 35 LCDAs were also enjoined to face the herculean task before them and “disregard the former illegal Chairmen who are merely seeking attention.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
