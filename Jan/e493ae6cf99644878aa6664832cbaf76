The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cautioned agents of the Buhari Presidency not to attempt to politicise or trivialise demands by Nigerians for the resignation of its government as a response to its evident failure to guarantee the security of lives and property in the country. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, the party stated that the Buhari Presidency “must accept this apolitical verdict, which transcends ethnic, political and religious boundaries, especially after President Muhammadu Buhari admitted failure by expressing ‘surprise’ at the level of insecurity across the nation under its watch.” According to the statement, “PDP notes that the fact that the Presidency resorted to hauling insults, hate language and threats against patriotic Nigerians, including senators, instead of addressing issues of security before the parliament, shows that indeed, the Buhari Presidency has no answer to the litany of insecurity issues under its administration “It is instructive for the Buhari Presidency to note that the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, whose voice resonated in the chamber of the Senate, spoke the mind of majority of Nigerians who had become bullied, harassed and despondent in the face of escalated insurgency, bloodletting, killings and other acts of violence that have pervaded our nation.

It, therefore, urged the National Assembly “to stand with Nigerians and resist every attempt that will make it succumb to any form of harassment, intimidations and innuendos from paid agents and cabal in the Presidency who have shown that the interest of ordinary Nigerians is not their priority.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
