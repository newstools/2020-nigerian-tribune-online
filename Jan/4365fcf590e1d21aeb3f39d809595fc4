She said the administration had employed over 200 new staff to beef up the operation and enforce the observance of the FCT Road Traffic Rules so as to boost the capacity of the Directorate of Road Traffic Services in discharging its core mandate of ensuring effective road traffic movement, minimise road crashes, stimulate clean environment and generate revenue for the FCT within the year. “Just recently, the FCT minister flagged off 22 operational vehicles, one number ambulance and 60 patrol motorcycles to enhance traffic management operations. To whom more is given, more is expected; the Directorate is now better poised to deliver on its mandate. “To this end, the Directorate has switched from manual to computerised vehicle inspection scheme to ensure that vehicles plying our roads are truly roadworthy. They are also removing and writing off all non-road worthy vehicles from the FCT roads. “The Directorate has improved on its road recovery activities in case of accidents through strategic positioning of its heavy-duty recovery equipment for a prompt response to emergencies.” She explained.
