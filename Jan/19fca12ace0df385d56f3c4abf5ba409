THE Muslim community of Eruwa in Ibarapa East Local Government Area of Oyo State has expressed delight over the appointment of one of their own, Dr Adebayo Ismail Adewusi, as the Postmaster-General of the Federation and chief executive officer of the Nigerian Postal Services (NIPOST). The community described Adewusi’s appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari as commendable, saying it would boost the Federal Government’s drive to accelerate the operations of NIPOST as a critical segment of the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. The Eruwa Muslim Community, in a statement signed by its chairman, Alhaji Abdul Lateef Afolabi and secretary, Malam Isiaki Adesokan, said with Adewusi’s track record as a seasoned public administrator, it was confident that he would prove his mettle quickly in his new assignment. The statement said: “The choice of Dr Adebayo Ismail Adewusi by President Muhammadu Buhari to lead NIPOST at this time in this  competitive age of technology is not misplaced. We applaud Mr President’s ability to recognise such an adept public administrator, just as we have no doubt in our minds that Dr Adewusi will sooner rather than later prove an invaluable asset to the Federal Government in its renewed drive to meet the needs of Nigerians, especially as they concern qualitative postal services. PDP replies Presidency, says Buhari ill-equipped for… Credible election: Match your words with action, CTA tells… I supplied AK-47 to bandits in Niger, Katsina, Zamfara,… Sanwo-Olu’s unscheduled visit boosts teachers’ morale at… “We have always known Dr Adewusi to be a God-conscious, honest and reliable member of the Eruwa Muslim ummah, and he has proved time and again that he is a go-getter when it comes to the management of businesses, organisations or institutions, public or private. “We have confidence in the talent and ability of this humble servant of Allah to reposition NIPOST and cause the organisation to begin to operate in a better and more successful way. “He was twice a commissioner in Lagos State and his achievements during the period speak volumes. We hope that our brother will bring his experience to bear in his new job. “We beseech Allah to grant him the grace to consolidate his reputation as a leading public administrator with higher records of performance and achievements in his new assignment.”  STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
