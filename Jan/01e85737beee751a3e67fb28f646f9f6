Respite has finally come the way of Umuzu, a hinterland community in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra state, as they will now have a secondary school through the Anambra State Community and Social Development Agency, under the World Bank Assisted Projects The General Manager of the Agency in the state, Mr Chudi Muojekwu announced the approval of the project when he led members of his team to hand over the cheque for the thirty per cent take-off fund for the project at the Umuzu village, yesterday. On arrival to Umuzu, a community rarely known by many will only remind you of the bible passage in Matthew 4: 16 “the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned.” Thus, the secondary school project carried out through the vulnerable group project of the community and social development programme, CSDP is like a shining light of hope. According to the project management implementation, the vulnerable group, the Oganiru Widows’ Association, Umuzu identified four projects of their needs out of which two pressing micro-projects were selected: the two blocks of classrooms for the secondary school and equipping of their barren health Centre, before the agency.
