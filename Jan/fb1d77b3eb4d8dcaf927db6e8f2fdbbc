The factional ward Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akungba Akoko, in Akoko South West Local Government Area of Ondo State, James Tolorunju Ajulo, who was kidnapped last Sunday, has regained freedom after payment of N2.5m to his abductors. Similarly, the 70-year-old woman, Mrs Fehintola Wewe, who was abducted last Friday in Sabomi in Ese Odo Local Government Area of the state, has also been released. While Ajulo was dropped at Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State capital,  Wewe was said to have been picked up in Lekki area in Lagos State. Confirming the release of the APC Chairman, a close friend of the family, Mr Tolu Babaleye, said Ajulo was released after payment of N2.5m to his abductors. He said the victim regained his freedom after being dropped in an area in Ado Ekiti before he was picked to his home in Akungba Akoko.

He described the release as an act of God, saying the family was not contacted and no ransom was demanded by the abductors before the woman was found around Lekki, Lagos State by security operatives. Confirming the release of the two victims,  the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr Femi Joseph, said the two victims had been released. He said no ransom was paid before the release of the Septuagenarian and the APC chairman. He, however, said men of the detectives from the command had begun an investigation into the matter with a promise to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. Tribune Online had reported that the two victims were abducted separately from their residences last week. Mrs Fehintola Wewe was kidnapped last Friday in her home around broad street, Sabomi, in Ese Odo local government area of the state, while Ajulo was abducted in his home in Akungba Akoko on Sunday by some hoodlums who ransacked his home before whisking him away.
