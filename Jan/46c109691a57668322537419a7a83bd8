The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai has announced the decision of the Nigerian Army to revive polo sport in the country. Buratai disclosed this while inaugurating a five-man Board of Trustees for the Nigerian Army Polo Association on Wednesday in Abuja. He stated that polo had been a long-standing military endeavour in promoting professionalism among officers. According to him, “Nigeria had been known to be good in polo game in the past and so we must revive the old game that the country is well known for. “If you go round the country, almost all the polo grounds that were initially constructed by the Nigerian army, are unconsciously handed over to other users due to dwindling participation of Nigerian army over the years.
