A non-governmental organisation, Bright Initiative for Sustainable Development, also known as Kogi Mandate Group (KMG) has congratulated the Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello and his Deputy Chief Edward Onoja as they take their oath of office and oath of allegiance, marking the beginning of the governor’s second term in office. Speaking to journalists in Lokoja immediately after the inauguration, the Director General of the group, Mr Gbemi Adejola, described the emergence of the Governor right from the beginning of his tenure as one with the hand of God, while encouraging him to consolidate on his earlier achievements for Kogites through more good works. While congratulating the governor for yet another peaceful transition, the group urged Kogites to continue praying for the governor so that God will use him to accomplish what he had designed for the state in his second term and as advocates of good governance, KMG will make haste to contribute their quota in areas that will be beneficial to the people.

We have no doubt that the Governor and his team will justify the seemingly overwhelming support repose in him by Kogites who gave him the mandate during the November 16 election.” ALSO READ: Ekiti PDP sacks LG chairman, 2 others over anti-party activities “As a group with the major aims and objective of advocating for good governance at all levels, we shall be airing our views on government policies and programmes with the intention of shaping governance for efficient delivery of dividends of democracy.
