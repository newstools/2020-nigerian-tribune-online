Concerned members of the South West caucus in the House of Representatives have expressed displeasure over the exclusion of federal politicians ahead of the launch of the regional security outfit popularly known as ‘Amotekun’ slated for Thursday, 9th January 2020. While some applauded the initiative, others were of the opinion that the move was a welcome development and long overdue. Speaking exclusively with Tribune Online, a former member of the 8th House of Representatives, Hon. Abiodun Famurewa (APC-Osun) applauded the initiative underscored the need for effective collaboration between Amotekun personnel and the security agencies such as Nigerian Police, Nigeria Army, Nigerian Navy and Nigerian Air Force. He said, “I believe a local security should be set up in all nooks and crannies to protect their territory better,” adding that the culture of deploying Nigerian Police Personnel from other states of the federation has not been effective to a great extent. He opined that the recruitment of indigenes of various communities into the Community Police such as Vigilante and Hunters will go a long way in tackling the menace of kidnapping, armed robbery and other social vices.

Famurewa also stressed that the incorporation of the Amotekun into the extant security apparatus would help in achieving the robust feat in intelligence gathering that would aid the operations of various security agencies.# ALSO READ: CBN retains banks’ loan to deposit ratio at 65 per cent Another serving lawmakers from Oyo State who spoke with Tribune Online but does not want his name in print, frowned at the exclusion of federal lawmakers during the process of working on the modalities of the regional security outfit. He opined that the State Governors should work with Traditional Rulers, Federal and State Lawmakers, retired and serving security operatives drawn from various states within the geopolitical zone. While noting that issue of State Police was basically opposed by stakeholders with the view to avoid hijack by politicians especially during elections, he, however, observed that the introduction of Amotekun and similar community police should be coordinated by the Nigeria Police. He further observed that the community policing framework should be designed in line with the operations of Police in developed countries such as US, UK, where Police do not carry arms but provide intelligence and help in nipping crime in the board within a short while.
