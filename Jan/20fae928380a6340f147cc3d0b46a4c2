Ashimolowo said: “I believe Nigerians will witness some of the dividends of the president in 2020. I think he is a honest, good, and a fantastic man. If you create steps, you will have a disorder. If you have a disorder, you will have corruption. That’s the truth. Nigeria should go way to check corruption and technology will help. “You have to realise that Nigeria is not isolated from the world. The whole world ps moving to smart technology and people are doing it. Nigeria is a great nation but if they don’t adjust, you may call me a prophet of doom, it will be a miracle for the youths of Nigeria to accept what is going on in the next 15 years.” The event was attended by clerics, traditional rulers, top government functionaries from Lagos, Ogun and Osun  States, and gospel musician, Evangelist Oladunni Olanrewaju, who sang at the programme.
