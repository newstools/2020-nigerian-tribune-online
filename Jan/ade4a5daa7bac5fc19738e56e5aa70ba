Chief Yomi Alliyu, SAN,  an Ibadan-based legal practitioner, has described Operation Amotekun has a child of necessity that would safeguard the security of lives and property in the South-West. Reacting to the declaration, on Tuesday, by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, that Amotekun is illegal, Alliyu said the failure of the Nigerian State to provide security for its people gave birth to the regional security outfit. Speaking in a telephone conversation with the Nigerian Tribune, he said: “Here we part! Amotekun is a child of necessity and since the constitution does not provide for necessity, it is legal under the Doctrine of Necessity.
