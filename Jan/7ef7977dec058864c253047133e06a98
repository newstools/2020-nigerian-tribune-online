A former member of the Nigerian Youth Parliament, Prince Adetayo Adekunle, has appreciated the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, the Director-General, Engr Mustapha Yunusa Maihaja, and the officials of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) for their prompt response to the plights of traders at Akesan Market in Oyo area of Oyo State. Adekunle, who also served as the Oyo State spokesperson of the Professor Yemi Osinbajo Support Group during the 2019 General Elections, made this assertion in a statement released in Ibadan. Following the Akesan Market inferno that occurred on Sunday, January 5, 2020, Adekunle reached out to the Office of the Vice President who is also the Chairman of the Board of the National Emergency Management Agency. From there, contact was established with the Director-General of the agency who set necessary machinery in motion. Sequel to the modest intervention of Adekunle and the efforts of other relevant stakeholders, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) distributed relief materials comprising 1,000 bags of cement, 1,000 bundles of roofing sheets, 200 packets of zinc nails as well as 100 bags of 3″ nails to the victims of the unfortunate incident in Oyo Alaafin on Thursday, January 16, 2020. 608 repentant Boko Haram members currently undergoing… Lai Mohammed tasks Nigerians on patriotism, commitment to… Malami’s statement on Amotekun is faulty, Olugbon… Barack Obama eulogises wife as she turns 56 ALSO READ: 115 promoted FRSC officers decorated in Anambra The symbolic presentation of the items to the people was performed by NEMA’s Acting Director of Relief and Rehabilitation, Dr Bandele Onimode, on behalf of the agency’s Director-General in Kosobo, the headquarters of Oyo East Local Government Area. It is instructive to note that prior to the distribution of the relief materials in Oyo, Prince Adekunle had earlier received the NEMA team led by Dr Onimode in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on the express instruction of the agency’s Director-General, Engr Mustapha Yunusa Maihaja. While appreciating NEMA’s prompt response, Adekunle further called on other organisations and individuals who have promised to deliver on time to assuage the plights of the good people of Oyo.
