The governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has assured the people of the state that the perpetrators of Tawari attack will be fished out and made to face the wrath of the law. This was as the casualty figures have risen to twenty-nine persons as more deaths were discovered from other communities within the district. Governor Bello, who held a peace meeting at the Government House Lokoja, on Thursday with the paramount rulers and people of the Tawari communities, called for calm said the government is working hard to restore permanent peace in the area. Bello, who acknowledged the peaceful disposition of the Tawari people, said the attack took place when there was no provocation, stressing that his administration will leave no stone unturned to unravel those behind the dastard acts against the communities. He noted that government on receiving the distress call acted proactively by drafting security personnel to secure the communities and to provide palliative measures for the people. He added that his government would not fold his arms and watch bandits and terrorists unleash mayhem on his people, insisting that he will adopt security measures that will be mobile and effective to deal with any security challenges across the country. He explained that the same methods that worked in Dekina, Bassa and Omala Local Government Areas when they were attacked, will be replicated in Tawari to bring a lasting solution to insecurity in the area.

He urged the traditional rulers, youth groups and opinion moulders in communities across the state to join hands with the government to ensure the success of the new security architecture to rid the state of criminals and people with predatory tendencies. The governor, however, directed the youth leader and the critical stakeholders of the communities to furnish his office within 24- 48 hours of the level of damage done to individuals for monetary compensation.

He appealed to the government to establish and strengthen the local vigilantes which according to him have the commitment and competence to deal with security infractions within their communities. He lamented at the frequent killings and kidnapping of Tawari people even in their homes and on the farms with consequences of the payment of humongous ransom and in some cases killing of the victims for failing to meet their demands, adding that the 2nd January 2020 attack was the climax of the gruesome murders of his people.

He appealed to the government to establish permanent security outpost in the area, reconstruct the damaged infrastructures, opening up the roads to the villages and to provide adequate medicaments for the injured who are receiving treatments in various hospitals and clinics within the state.
