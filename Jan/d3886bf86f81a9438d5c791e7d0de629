A Kano High Court presided by Justice Nuradeen Sagir on Wednesday adjourned till January 27 for the continuation of hearing a suit filed by 20 Kano elders against Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and others over the creation of four new Emirate councils in the state. It would be recalled that the case was filed by the 20 Kano State elders led by a former presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Bashir Tofa, challenging the creation of four new emirates council in the state by Kano state government. However, during the proceeding on Wednesday, Kano State Government filed preliminary objections challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case. On Wednesday, the State Attorney General, Barrister Ibrahim Mukthar, said in a counter-affidavit that the creation of the new Emirate Council is a matter of public interest litigations in which some 20 elders could not stand for over 20 millions Kano indigenes.

Barrister A.B Muhmud, counsel to the plaintiffs, however, protested the Attorney General’s late service of the counter-affidavits which he said were filed since 31st December but were served to them only on 7th January 2020. The presiding judge, Justice Sagir, who is the State Chief Judge waded into the misunderstanding on the late service of the preliminary objections by the attorney general and resolved the matter. The case was then adjourned to 27 January 2020 for the continuation of hearing on the motion on notice in the matter.
