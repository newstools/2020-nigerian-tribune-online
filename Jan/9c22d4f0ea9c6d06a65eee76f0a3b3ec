If we are not protecting and giving welfare to our people, then we have drifted from the ideals of the founding fathers, hence the need for the Government to do the needful and restore confidence of the people “The House is worried that as 22 victims of such attacks are being buried today and several survivors in displaced camps, there is need for a beef-up of security in the entire constituency and indeed Plateau State to forestall any breakdown of law and order”. While condemning the spate of killings of innocent citizens across the country and the plight of the internally displaced persons (IDPs), the House urged National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to provide relief materials, rebuild their destroyed homes, provide drugs and sanitation in the affected areas with immediate effect. To this end, the House mandated all the relevant committees to monitor the situation and report back within two weeks. Meanwhile, the Plateau Police Command has confirmed the arrest of the Fulani and community leaders from Mangu, Bokkos, Barkin Ladi and Riyom Local Government Areas and immediately ordered their transfer to Nigerian Police headquarters, Abuja for further interrogation as a result of the crisis that took place in parts of Bokkos local government area of the state.
