The Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on Thursday charged Yorubas in Nigeria and diaspora to continue to maintain their pacesetter status and value. He gave the charge when the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Otunba Gani Adams led other descendants of Oduduwa to pay courtesy at his palace in Ile-Ife as part of the annual Oduduwa festival. Oba Ogunwusi described the descendants of Oduduwa who are often referred to Yorubas as uniquely created by the Most High God. According to him, “take a close look at our people, their conduct and lifestyle anywhere in the world, you will agree with me that we are uniquely different. No matter where we find ourselves, we are pacesetters and that is the value we must continue to uphold.” In his remark, Adams described the Ooni as the only monarch with the seal of Oduduwa, expressing that he holds the foremost African traditional ruler in very high esteem. He stated “as the Arole Oduduwa, all descendants of Oduduwa must bow in respect for the highly respected throne because he is the father of all. I respect him so much because he is my father and I will continue to do so.” Your govt is tainted with nepotism, Gani Adams tells Buhari Amotekun is blessing in disguise to SouthWest ― Gani Adams Ooni to celebrate 100 exceptional young Nigerians Gani Adams celebrates 2nd anniversary, installs new chiefs ALSO READ: Fire guts Lagos building While acknowledging the Ooni for his relentless efforts towards uniting the descendants of Oduduwa, Adams expressed his joy over what he described an improved level of unity in Yorubaland which he said was fully displayed in the formation of the South-West Security Network, also known as Operation Amotekun recently. “Let me commend Kabiesi, the Oonirisa, the Alaafin of Oyo and other prominent Obas, leaders of socio-cultural organizations, civil society groups and individuals for supporting the crusade for Operation Amotekun. “The events that played out during the crusade for Operation Amotekun clearly indicated that the Yoruba blood truly flows in our veins.” “When the issue of Amotekun came up, I took up the challenges, and like a lone ranger, I made my position known to the world, without minding whose ox is gored. I said it clearly, that whoever that is against the initiative was an enemy of our race. “It shows that in unity, everything is possible. So I am using this opportunity to appeal to all the states House of Assemblies to do the needful by legislating the initiative, by giving it the necessary legal backing. When this is done, we can be sure of winning the war for a better future”, Adams stated SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
