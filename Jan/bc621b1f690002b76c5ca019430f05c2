Shares of Continental Reinsurance were eventually delisted from the daily official list of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Friday, January 17, 2020. A statement issued by the Head of Listings Regulations Department of the exchange, Mr Godstime Iwenekhai, stated that the delisting followed the company’s application to quit the local bourse. It also came nearly two months after the stock exchange management placed shares of the firm on full suspension. The suspension was done to prevent transacting in the shares beyond the effective date of the scheme of arrangement by which CRe African Investments Limited will acquire all the shares of CRe Nigeria.
