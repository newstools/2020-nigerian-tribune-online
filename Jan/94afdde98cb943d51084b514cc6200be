KANO State governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has approved the appointment of seven Special Advisers (SAs) and 10 Senior Special Assistants (SSAs). This is just as he urged all the appointees to work diligently for sound execution of government policies, programmes and projects. He said: “It is your responsibility to show to Nigerians that, you are indeed serving a regime that excels in many human endeavours. So you have every reason to work very hard.” By way of specifically commending those of them who are coming to positions for the second time, like Alhaji Bawuro, Salihu Tanko, Ahmad Ladan and Auwal Aranposu, Governor Ganduje encouraged that, “you performed wonderfully well during our first tenure in office. Your second coming on board is not only deserving and timely, but it is apt and encouraging.” According to him, those who served under him in the first tenure of his administration, apart from understanding government’s policies and working towards achieving optimal results, “did their best and assisted in our victory for the second tenure. “It is noteworthy to fully understand how you are selected and appointed into various offices as Special Advisers and Senior Special Assistants, which automatically calls for commitment, deserving loyalty, openness, integrity and sincerity of purpose as public office holders,” Ganduje added.
