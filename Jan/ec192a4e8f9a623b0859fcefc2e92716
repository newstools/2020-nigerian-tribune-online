President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday commended Governor Bello Matawalle’s efforts at tackling banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities in Zamfara State. The president made the commendation in a message to the maiden convocation of Federal University, Gusau. The president, who was represented by Prof. Hafiz Abubakar of the National Universities Commission (NUC), noted that the over a decade of insecurity in the state has drastically reduced following the peace and reconciliation initiative of the governor. He noted that the initiative has led to unconditional release of kidnapped victims as well as the surrender of several arms by repentant bandits. The president expressed confidence in the nation’s security agencies to end criminality in the country and urged other states to emulate the Zamfara initiative. He called for proper reintegration of the repentant bandits and other criminals into the society, so as to be good citizens and contribute positively to nation-building. Earlier, Governor Matawalle thanked the university for giving him an award of excellence. He promised to do more in the education sector in order to take the state to greater heights.
