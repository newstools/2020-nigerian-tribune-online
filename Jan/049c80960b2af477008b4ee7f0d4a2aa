President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Mr Akinwumi Adesina, has said the bank will work closely with the Africa Advisory Group of the London Stock Exchange Group (LAAG) to attract a bigger share of the $5 trillion global Exchange Traded Fund Assets under management into African capital markets.
