Justice Patricia Ajoku of a Federal High Court in Ibadan, on Friday, sentenced Ezekiel Orimolade, an undergraduate student at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) to four months imprisonment for defrauding an American man of 150 dollars. Ajoku held that the court sentenced Orimolade, based on the evidence before her and the plea bargain agreement he had with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “I have considered the plea bargain agreement entered into by the convict as well as the provisions of Section 270 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015 in this judgment.

Earlier, counsel to the EFCC Ibadan zonal office, Mr Babatunde Sonoiki had told the court that the convict was facing a one-count amended charge bordering on impersonation. Sonoiki added that the convict committed the crime on Sept. 28, 2019, in Ibadan, Oyo State. According to the prosecutor, Orimolade disguised as a white U.S. citizen to one American man, Nelisa Snell that he was deeply in love with him through the Internet. “Snell, therefore, sent Orimolade 150 dollars, believing that he had found a lover,” Sonoiki said. The offence he said, contravened Section 22(A) of the cybercrime law of the Federation 2006. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that anyone convicted of the offence was liable to a minimum of seven years imprisonment. NAN SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
