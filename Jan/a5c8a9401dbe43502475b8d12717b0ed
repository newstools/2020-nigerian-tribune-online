Nigeria’s Information Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo continually preach against hate speech. But it is now clear who is responsible for hate speech based on the assertion of the Attorney-General of the Federation, Malami. The likes of Malami did not declare Sharia illegal during President Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime; they did not declare Civilian JTF with army uniform and military wares illegal and unconstitutional or what is their specific role in the 1999 constitution as amended? The Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari with Malami committed a breach of 1999 constitution as amended and deserve impeachment if we have lawmakers who are not rubber stamps. Appointing all security chief from one tribe is illegal because it is not in conformity with the spirit of federalism and federal character. There are many acts of illegality that are committed in Nigeria. Governors are chief security officers in their states but they are put at the mercy of the president, Police Inspector-General and the military commanders as evidenced during elections. Is Malami’s disobedience of court orders legal or illegal? What of DSS’ invasion of the Senate and its very recent invasion of the high court to arrest Omoyele Sowore? Malami never declared the DSS act as illegal nor those who want to save lives like Civilian JTF in the North east Nigeria who wear military uniforms. Adopting radically system of farming What next after Amotekun? Nigeria and bandits VC canvasses individual endowment for LAUTECH Malami should go and re-read law books and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If your northern Civilian JTF are legal, Amotekun of western region is legal because they are performing similar roles. Fulani herdsmen are enjoying immunity for evil actions. Malami should be warned by President Buhari or those who love the unity of Nigeria should caution, warn and call Malami to order. All governors, Yoruba leaders and all of us that witnessed the establishment of Amotekun should defend it because  of the future of the coming generation. If we display cowardice in the face of challenges, trials, vicissitudes and travails caused by the 1914 amalgamation, posterity will not forgive all of us now living.
