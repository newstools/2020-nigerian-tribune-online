THE $2 billion tax demanded from MTN Nigeria Communications Plc by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Mr Abubakar Malami, has been withdrawn, MTN Group confirmed on Friday. In a statement issued over the weekend, the Africa’s largest telecommunications network provider said its legal representatives in the matter received a letter from AGF informing them of the latest development. In the said letter dated Wednesday, January 8, 2020, the Nigeria’s chief law officer said he was stepping aside from the case for the relevant agencies to handle. He said the tax issue will now be pursued by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). According to Mr Malami, this decision was reached after that careful review and due consultation with these agencies of federal government. Recall that in August 2018, the AGF asked MTN Nigeria to pay a tax of $2 billion. This prompted the company to file a suit against the AGF on September 4, 2018. At a hearing last month, the case was adjourned to January 30, 2020.
