A victim of human trafficking, Victoria Oshioke, has narrated how she was sold to Mali for N350,000 when she was just 16 years old. Oshioke in a statement she made to the NSCDC officials said that she was first trafficked to Mali by her boyfriend. She added that the boyfriend later sold her to a Benin Republic-based syndicate for N350,000. The victim was again about to be trafficked to an unnamed African country when operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) intercepted another trafficking syndicate in Lagos.
