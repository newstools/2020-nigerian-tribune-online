FOR Nigeria’s electronic commerce (eCommerce) sub-sector to grow, become profitable, and subsequently impact the economy, more education is required. This should be supported by various government’s policies and infrastructure development. These were the part of the observations of the immediate past Chief Executive Officer, Jumia Nigeria, Mrs. Juliet Anammah, who has been elevated as the Chairwoman, Jumia Nigeria and Head of Institutional Affairs, Jumia Africa.. Addressing journalists in Lagos last week, Anammah said logistics was also very key to sustaining the growth of the sub-sector. While appreciating the efforts of government in creating an enabling environment for businesses to survive in the country, the Jumia Chairwoman noted that eCommerce is just growing in this part of the world, “so, there must be collaboration among all stakeholders, including government and consumers on how to make it more competitive like other climes.” She said the company will focus more on customers and vendors in order to drive business sustainability and profitability this year in order to sustain the growth of the company. As part of the 2020 drive, Anammah’s  new role will see her oversee Jumia’s operations across its African markets, while Mr Massimiliano Spalazzi becomes the new Chief Executive Officer for Jumia Nigeria and EVP Marketplace at Jumia Group.
