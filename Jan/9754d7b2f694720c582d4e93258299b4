The importance of education to societal development cannot be over-emphasised, hence the need for the sponsorship,’’ he said. The legislator, who said that he intended to make the programme an annual event, urged other well-to-do Nigerians to partner with government through investment in education. He assured of his continued readiness and willingness to partner with any organisation with a convincing idea about improving the standard of education in his constituency and the state at large.
