A bill which seeks to criminalise non-remittance of internally generated revenues (IGR) by various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) including Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has been gazetted for legislative action in the House of Representatives. Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Honourable Benjamin Kalu, sponsored the ‘Bill for an Act to require statutory bodies to prepare and forward to the National Assembly through the President annual reports of its operations and finances; and for related matters’. The proposed legislation is coming amidst grave concerns over the increase in the number of MDAs who fail to adhere to relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and extant financial regulations. Information gathered by Tribune Online showed that, in 2011, 76 MDAs failed to submit audited reports, in 2012, no fewer than 85 MDAs defaulted; in 2013, total number of 109 MDAs defaulted; in 2014, at least 148 MDAs defaulted; in 2015, total number of 215 MDAs did not submit the audit report while in 2016 323 MDAs also defaulted in submitting the required annual audit reports to oAuGF for scrutiny. Office of the Auditor General of the Federation (OAuGF) had in its recent audit report indicated that 265 MDAs violated the fiscal and audit rules governing the operations of government accounts in the 2017 fiscal year, resulting in non-remittance of over N300 billion into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In his 2016 report, the Auditor-General complained that “most of the government corporations, companies and commissions have not submitted their audited accounts for 2016 to me.” From the report, as of April 2018, 109 agencies had not submitted (their audited accounts) beyond 2013, 76 agencies last submitted for the 2010 financial year while 65 agencies have never submitted any account since inception.

Some of the issues raised in the 2017 report included the delay of the passage of the budget and how it affected the MDAs in the implementation of projects. A summary of the report shows a lack of revenue remittance by some revenue-generating agencies of government. According to the report, the MDAs that deduct the statutory Withholding Taxes, Value Added Taxes, Stamp Duty, Capital Gains Tax and other statutory taxes did not carry out their duties appropriately to the benefit of the Federal Government, thereby leading to a significant reduction in revenue accruable to the Federal Government. It further stated that 16 revenue-generating agencies did not remit a total of N19,025,384,100.29 to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, with the Bureau of Public Enterprise topping the list of unremitted revenue, with the sum of N7,585,116,400.00 We also found that revenue-generating agencies dissipate funds on excessive overhead expenditure and extra-budgetary expenditure on contracts thereby reducing their operating surplus. Furthermore, 26 of the MDAs that were audited did not deduct and/or remit a total of N1,650,417,379.30. Overall, the audit found that the sum of N20,675,801,479.59 in various taxes (PAYE, WHT, VAT, etc.) in the year under review, was not remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government by the MDAs. Considering the multiplicity of the existing federal agencies estimated at over 850 established by the Acts of National Assembly, Clause 6(1 & 2) of the bill, provides that the bill “consequentially amends all Acts of the National Assembly establishing statutory bodies in Nigeria.
