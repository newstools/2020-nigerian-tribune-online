Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has said his administration is putting in place measures to empower young people and strengthen local businesses to discourage Kwarans from seeking so-called greener pastures abroad and endangering their lives. “What our government is doing is trying to create a better environment for the youth to excel in their chosen businesses. The 2020 budget has been structured to empower businesses and promote entrepreneurship in the state,” AbdulRazaq said late Wednesday when the state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), led by Commandant Bello Ale, brought the lady repatriated from Lebanon Gloria Taiye Bright to the Governor. AbdulRazaq said the government has made provisions for skills acquisition for Kwarans, especially young people.

We are going to work with his office to ensure that all Kwarans still trapped in the country are all brought back home,” he said when a delegation of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) visited him on Thursday afternoon. The Governor, who said the administration is footing the bill of such repatriation, also commended the efforts of the NSCDC and the nonprofit organisation Phemnic Life Support involved in the development. “We all watched the video online and I want to thank the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, the NAPTIP and Phemnic Life Support for the prompt actions which led to the repatriation,” he said. “There are thousands of people who are victims of trafficking, as many youths in their quest for better opportunities fall into wrong hands who took advantage of the situation.” Ale, for his part, commended AbdulRazaq for the support he offered while the agency worked to track down some suspects connected to the development and the repatriation of the lady.
