Kano State Commissioner for Education, Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa’id Kiru, has expressed the readiness of the state government to admit an additional 100 students among the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) into Mariri Boarding Primary and Junior Secondary School. This was contained in a statement signed and issued by Ministry of Education Public Relations Officer (PRO), Aliyu Yusuf, a copy made available to pressmen on Tuesday. The statement stated that Kiru made the disclosure when he and his counterpart in the Ministry of Women Affairs, Dr Zahrau Muhammad Umar, jointly received the committee representing the parents of the IDP students at the school premises. The Commissioner of Education disclosed that accommodating additional students will go a long way in bringing succour to the IDP children who lost their parents as a result of insurgency in Borno State. While speaking on the disagreement between the Ministry of Women Affairs and SUBEB on managing the affairs of the school, Kiru called for a review of the documents that established the school with a view to resolving the issue amicably. 66 Oyo primary schools to benefit from UBEC programme Man butchers fellow man, eats his testicles, body parts Tawari attack: Senator Adeyemi meets NEMA, seeks immediate… Uniport undergraduate wins Princewill’s Trust December… ALSO READ: Be constructive in your criticism, Tambuwal tells Sokoto APC However, the statement said the commissioner of women affairs emphasized the importance of assisting orphans in the society while appealing to wealthy individuals and other agencies to complement government’s effort in running the school. Umar, however, expressed worry over the confusion between her ministry and the SUBEB in running the affairs of the school, stressing the need by the ministry of education to intervene. Speaking earlier, the leader of the committee, Hon. Fanta Baba Shehu, said that the quarterly visit to the school was initiated to enable the IDP students to have a sense of belonging. She, however, disclosed that the majority of the students were carefully selected from the 27 local governments of Borno state. During the visit, the committee brought two sets of uniforms, a sandal and shoes, vest and other materials for the 200 IDP students.
