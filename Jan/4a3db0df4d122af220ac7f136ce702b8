Speaking while briefing the management at the Corps National Headquarters, Abuja, Gana described the death of the politician as an unfortunate and a great loss to the family of the deceased, the entire people of Imo State and Nigeria in general. The CG who was deeply saddened by the ugly incident disclosed that the errant officer has been arrested and handed over to the police and that due diligence would be followed in ensuring that the personnel is punished and justice served accordingly.

He expressed regrets over the incident and apologized to the family of the deceased and Nigerians on behalf of the Corps. He also commiserated with members of his political party, the Imo state government and the entire Imo people, praying that the Almighty God would grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and the deceased eternal rest. He charged all state Commandants to make sure that “the ugly incident does not repeat itself by constantly reading the rules of engagement to all armed men in their commands and ensuring periodic screening to keep them in check”. He, however, assured Nigerians that the NSCDC will continue to strive to live above board, reiterating that the recent psychological profiling of officers and men carried out across state commands was geared towards flushing out anyone with questionable character or unstable personality especially in the armed squad as the Corps would not allow its reputation and integrity to be soiled or compromised by a few unscrupulous individuals. Gana said he has set up a disciplinary committee and the personnel would be tried accordingly and if found culpable might face dismissal and subsequent prosecution. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
