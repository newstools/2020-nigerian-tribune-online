People of Bauchi State have been called to accept the outcome of the Supreme Court judgement on the state gubernatorial election so that peace will continue to reign in the state. The call was made by youths in the state under the aegis of Arewa Youth Initiative and Mass Mobilisation for Voting Wisely during a press conference held at the NUJ Press Center, Bauchi on Sunday. The group said that Bauchi is a peaceful state and centre of democracy in the country. Leader of the group, Abdulkadir Abdullahi, stressed that members of the group are very confident that the court verdict will not cause any breakdown of law and order in the state because according to him, no crisis arose from the previous judgements by the Tribunal and Court of Appeal.

The group also called on Supreme Court justices who will sit on the case to be fair and just as well as uphold what the constitution of the country stipulates in such situations in order for democracy to continue to thrive in the country.
