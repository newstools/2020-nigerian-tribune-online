In a bid to motivate more entrants into research, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has said it would provide incentives and the necessary support for researchers across tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria. Executive Secretary of TETFund, Prof. Suleiman Elias Bogoro, made the disclosure at the Capacity Building Workshop with special focus on Effective Research Administration, held in Dubai recently. Prof. Bogoro who noted that the future of Nigeria lies in Research and Innovation urged government to institutionalize R&D by prescribing a law to set aside certain percentage of funds for research purpose. He urged participants to ‘’up their game’’ and come up with problem solving research that can address the numerous challenges facing the nation, adding that TETFund is always ready to incentivise and encourage researchers. eCommerce is crucial to Nigeria’s economic growth-Anammah,… Iwo indigenes charged to develop hometown Employment policies are key to address challenge of… Nigeria seeks $1.1bn loan to fund special agriculture… The Executive Secretary also stated that TETFund is set to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Science and Technology, all in a bid to encourage Research and Development. He encouraged participants to be committed and make the best out of the workshop, as TETFund is edging towards a paradigm shift from physical infrastructure to content component/knowledge-based intervention. Prof. Bogoro expressed appreciation to the Honourable Minister of Education, Mal. Adamu Adamu and the TETFund Board of Trustees for their immense support and cooperation towards the Research and Development drive of the Fund. Also speaking at the workshop, Lead facilitator, Professor Ibrahim Katampe stated that one of the major goals of the capacity building workshop was to equip participants with the necessary skills and competencies essential for managing Research Centres such as coordinating research activities, attracting research grants, tracking project implementation, acquiring patents and developing partnerships and collaborations. In his remarks, Chairman of TETFund’s National Research Fund Screening and Monitoring (NRFS&M) Committee, Prof. Olufemi Bamiro urged participants and Head of Institutions to be more responsible in handling research funds.
