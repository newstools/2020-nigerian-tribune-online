The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is set to arraign a former Attorney-General of Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bello Adoke, and six others over infractions relating to the controversial Oil Prospecting License (OPL)245, popularly referred to as Malabu Oil. Adoke and his co-defendants who arrived the court Wednesday afternoon are to be arraigned before Justice Idris Kutigi of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, sitting at Gwagwalada, Abuja. Others to be arraigned with Adoke presently are Aliyu Abubakar, Rasky Gbinigie, Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited. They are to be arraigned on a 42-count charge bordering on gratification, forgery, among others.
