THE Federal Government has said that Nigeria and some developing countries are yet to be included in the International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSe) Index because of lack of relevant data needed for the assessment. Acting Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, made this known on Tuesday in Abuja while declaring open a five-day workshop on the Technical Paper emanating from the assessment of the applicability of the InCiSe index methodology to Nigeria. She disclosed that only about 43 per cent of relevant data for assessment was available in Nigeria, saying there was the need to work hard to bridge the gaps. She said her office also accorded data-driven decision making a priority in the implementation of the Federal Civil Service Strategy and Implementation Plan (FCSSIP)-2020. Yemi-Esan explained that the International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) index is a collaboration between the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford and the Institute for Government. She added that the project has been supported by the United Kingdom (UK) Civil Service and is funded by the Open Society Foundations. According to her, the index forms the basis for benchmarking, measuring and assessing the performance of public services globally. She said: “It will interest you to note that InCiSE Index which currently covers 38 countries made its maiden publication in 2017 and currently applies the following 12 indicators in the assessment of the effectiveness of civil service: Capabilities, Crisis and risk management, Digital services, Fiscal and financial management, Human resources (HR) management, Inclusiveness, Integrity, Openness, Policymaking, Procurement, Regulation, Tax administration.

Yemi-Esan noted that the Nigeria Civil Service was at the point where it needs such international assessment and comparison in view of the critical role played by an effective civil service in determining a country’s progress and prosperity. “An effective civil service guarantees socio-economic stability and prosperity while an ineffective civil service results in countries drowning in the quagmire of instability and abject poverty,” she said.
