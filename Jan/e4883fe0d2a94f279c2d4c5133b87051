Governor Simon Lalong has stated that if the killers of Ropvil Daciya, a 200-level student of the University of Maiduguri who was murdered by Boko Haram justified their actions on the fact that he is from Plateau State and a Christian, then it means he died for Plateau. The governor who stated this when he led a delegation comprising his wife, the state deputy governor Professor Sony Tyoden and others to the family of the deceased in Pankshin local government area of the state said the late Ropvil died for the state. “We will soon do something to keep his memory. His killers will never have peace and one day, they will pay the price of their evil whether here on earth or in the life after. Definitely their reward is hell, while his own reward is in heaven”. The Governor implored the family to take solace in the fact that God who is the ultimate judge knows everything and will avenge the killing of Ropvil.

Young men with skills that have contributed positively to the growth of the economy and in providing succour to Nigerians thrown into poverty by this group” He urged Nigerians to change the stereotype that the ranging issue was strictly Plateau affairs adding that leaving the monster untamed will consume everyone in no distance future if care was not taken. The chairman, therefore, called on President Mohammadu Buhari to overhaul the security architecture in the country especially the Service Chief and ensure a national balance both by region and religious persuasion. Kanda further appealed to the National Assembly to take more proactive steps by partnering with the Executives to ensure decimation of not only Boko Haram but other terrorist organisation in the country. The YOWICAN also called on the Plateau State Government to make arrangements with other universities in the country, particularly the higher institutions on the Plateau where lives of Plateau youths will be safe for the purpose of admission and inter University transfers.
