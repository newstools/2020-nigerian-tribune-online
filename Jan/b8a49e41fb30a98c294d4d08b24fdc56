Regarding the good use of social media, Nigerian youths have been tasked by the Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege to deploy the power of the media to positive use to effect leadership change in the society, rather than the practice of pulling down their leaders. Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege gave the charge on Thursday, in Abuja while playing host to the African Biblical Leadership Initiative (ABLI). The delegation was led by a former Minister of Information and Professor of history, Jerry Gana. Omo-Agege counsel is contained in a statement signed by Yomi Odunuga, Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, to the Deputy President of the Senate. While expressing his support for the ABLI conference billed for Nigeria in October this year, Senator Omo-Agege said the conference will help youth imbibe biblical virtues and values.

A ministry of some sort to reach meet the wider needs of society through good governance and development for a harmonious society. He explained that this has become necessary because the orientation we have right now about the concept of leadership is more about rulership. And it shouldn’t be that way. That is the orientation that the bulk of our youth have also taken. “This is an initiative that will help to reorient our youth into going back to those original biblical virtues and values. It is an initiative that anyone of goodwill who means well for his country will want to support”. Earlier, Chairman Organising Committee of the forthcoming conference, Professor Jerry Gana, revealed that the event would hold from October 26 to 30, this year. According to him, the African Biblical Leadership Initiative (ABLI) seeks to empower African leaders with biblical truths which will foster integrity in leadership. He solicited the support of the Deputy President of the Senate in mobilizing Christian senators and youths to the conference. The delegation included the General Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN), Dr. Richard Dare Ajiboye; Angela Lopez of the British and Foreign Bible Society; Gilbert Mohammed among others.
