Justice Yusuf Halilu of High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Monday morning, convicted Maryam Sanda accused of killing her husband, Bilyaminu Haliru Bello. She was thereby sentenced to death by hanging until she breathes her last. The judge held that she was convicted as charged by the police for killing her husband in the night of November 18, 2017 in the home at Wuse II in Abuja. According to the judge, Sanda failed to explain the death of her husband being the last person seen with him and held that she stabbed her with a knife.
