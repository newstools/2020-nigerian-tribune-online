The apex socio-cultural umbrella body of the Urhobo people, Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide has warned South-South governors to prepare to battle worsened insecurity when criminals that’ll be flushed out by Operation Amotekun from the South West begin to relocate to the region. The Urhobo body, which lauded the emergence of the Western Nigeria Security Network, also known as ‘Operation Amotekun’,  therefore called on the South South governors to establish a similar regional security outfit. In a statement from the office of the President-General, Olorogun Moses Taiga, the Urhobo union urged governors of the South South to emulate their South West counterparts. “The Nigerian Police is currently overwhelmed by the prevailing internal security challenges. “The army has been drafted to help the police in some areas, but we all know that it is not what the army is trained to do. “There have been agitations for state police and better organised community policing. Amotekun is a response to the current security challenges in the South-West. ‘Amotekun’ is meant to help the Federal Government combat insecurity in the land. “The baby should not be thrown away with the bath water because Amotekun is needed.

Criminality knows no ethnicity. “The South West should continue to dialogue with the Federal Government to smoothen the rough edges. “The Urhobo Progress Union fully aligns with the ideals of Amotekun,” the statement reiterated. Justifying the call for a similar security outfit, the UPU warned that “by the time Amotekun succeeds in chasing away criminals from the South West, they will relocate to the South South and the area will become uninhabitable.” Taiga disclosed that with the current challenges in the region where many farmers, particularly in Delta State, have died as a result of activities of murderous herdsmen, a local security outfit akin to ‘Operation Amotekun’ will stem the tide. “We need to study what the South West has done and the ongoing dialogue with the federal government so that the South South, especially Delta State, can set up a similar security outfit,” the stament added. “If the South South is not pro-active, by the time Amotekun succeeds in chasing away criminals from the South-West, they will relocate to the South South and the area will become uninhabitable.
