President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday met with the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The ASUU leadership was led by its President, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi. NAN reliably learnt that the meeting was at the instance of the university lecturers who have been resisting enrolling on the Federal Government`s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Buhari had ordered the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to stop the payment of salaries of Federal Government workers, including members of ASUU, who failed to enrol on the IPPIS platform by October 31, 2019. The government later extended the deadline to November 30, 2019.
