In continuation of its efforts to ensure safety in the society, the officials of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Sokoto State have sealed off seven retail outlets of Liquefied Petroleum Gas otherwise known as cooking gas operating within Sokoto metropolis. The affected outlets, according to Mohammed Makera, Head DPR Sokoto Field Office, were axed for operating in unsafe environments and without obtaining a licence. Makera stated that for a total number of seventeen cooking gas outlets inspected, five were sanctioned for operating without obtaining licence while two were shut down for safety reason.

The controller disclosed that the DPR had in September 2019, organised sensitisation exercise where all operators of Liquefied Petroleum Gas retail outlets in Sokoto were asked to acquire licence or risk close down their facilities. He vowed that the Department will not relent in ensuring that the issue of safety is taken seriously by all and sundry. “We are looking at the safety aspect of it because you can not be operating near schools or live electrical wires. This exercise will continue with the assistance of security agencies till all retail outlets comply with safety measures and we will not relent in sensitising them.” He maintained. He, however, urged prospective retailers to always approach DPR office for sensitisation, procedure tips and approval before setting up such gas stores rather than endangering their lives and that of the public.
