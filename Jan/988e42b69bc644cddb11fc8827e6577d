Indigenes of Offa in Kwara State from all Christian faiths under the aegis of the Offa Christian Indigenes Union (OCIU) have called on government to urgently address issues of corruption and insecurity in the country. Speaking at the fifth convention of the union in Offa at the weekend, president of the body, Elder Segun Opaleke, said that Nigerians should be hopeful of socioeconomic and political progress when the two major issues were tackled. Opaleke, who said aims of the union included promoting unity among Offa Christians, irrespective of denominations, added that its objective included promoting interfaith understanding for peace among Offa Christians and non-Christians. Also speaking, minister-in-charge of Calvary Baptist Church, Offa, Reverend Samuel Adeyemo, who spoke on empowering Christian faithful for sustainability of evangelism in Offa, commended the empowerment programme of the union.
