The academy, aside now boasting of world class facilities and lecturers, offer relatively low school fees compared to what these private maritime institutions offer, so they see the academy as bad business. “To make sure the Academy’s growing fortune nosedive, some of these maritime institutions have employed the services of some senior officials of some maritime regulatory agencies to work against the Academy. “We know this people that are working on-behalf of these maritime institutions against the Academy, and very soon, we will blow the lid on them. “Should people become so selfish as to work against government establishment just to ensure that their own businesses thrive? It’s quite unfortunate that this is happening, and very soon, we will blow the lid on these saboteus.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
