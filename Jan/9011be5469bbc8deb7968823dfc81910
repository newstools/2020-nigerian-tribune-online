The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said that Methanol Production Technology will create jobs and wealth in Nigeria. A statement by the ministry’s spokesman, in Abuja, Abdulganiyu Aminu, said the minister made this known at the Second Inter-Ministerial meeting of the implementation of the National Policy on Methanol Fuel Production Technology. “Nigeria’s enormous gas resources will be converted into useful products, through methanol technology, thereby paving the way for other businesses to grow. “The introduction of methanol technology will go a long way in reducing gas flaring in the environment,” Onu said. He noted that the demand for gas by businesses would tremendously reduce gas flaring.
