For Grace Idowu, budding gospel singer and songwriter, touching lives with her angelic voice has always been her passion. But beyond that, Idowu is driven by her God-given talent to keep inspiring people, particularly the young minds, who according to her are easily swayed by what they see and hear. The contemporary singer, who started singing at the tender age of 11 in an interactive session with Tribuneonline said her music career got inspired by the likes of American gospel singer, Kierra Sheard and Nigeria’s gospel singer, Victoria Orenze. With new music in the pipeline, Idowu said she would be storming the industry with a breath of fresh air as she plans to drop new projects anytime from now. After emerging a recording artiste at the age of 17 when she wrote her first single, entitled Odogwu, which was released in 2018, Idowu, who is currently studying Music at Babcock University insisted that hers is a music that would touch hearts.
