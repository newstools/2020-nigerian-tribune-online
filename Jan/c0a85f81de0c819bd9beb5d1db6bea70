A chieftain of the Pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Senator Ayo Fasanmi, on Wednesday said that the security outfit launched by South-West governors, Amotekun, was the best solution to the increasing rate of insecurity in the region. Speaking in an interview with the Tribune Online, Senator Fasanmi who lauded the initiative of the governors frowned at those criticising the establishment of the security outfit. He described them as collaborators of insurgents. Senator Fasanmi who is also a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), however, cautioned the governors against reckless use of the security outfit, saying it should rather be used for the benefit of the people of the region. He, however, dismissed the claims in some quarters that the security outfit might be used for political motives by the governors. According to him, “the Amotekun security outfit established by the South West governors is the best solution to the increasing and alarming rates of insecurity in the region. Declaring Amotekun illegal is a breach Adopting radically system of farming What next after Amotekun?

The critics of the security outfit are collaborators of insurgents, if not how can a right-thinking human being be seen criticising such a laudable initiative? “The governors should not be power-drunk, the security outfit should not be used recklessly, they should not use it for their interest, rather it should be used judiciously for the interest of all and sundry. “With the security outfit on the ground now, the worst insecurity days are over, the criminals and their collaborators will be chased out and dealt with.” On the legality of the security outfit, Senator Fasanmi said that the governors did not in anyway breach the law of the land as the state houses of assembly would do the needful to back their governors. He appealed to individuals, groups and spirited organisations to support the initiative in the overall interest of the region and the country as no meaningful development could take place in any crisis-ridden society anywhere in the world.
