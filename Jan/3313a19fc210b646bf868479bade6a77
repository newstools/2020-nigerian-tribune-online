Professor Abiodun Otegbayo, UCH’s Chief Medical Director, declaring open five-day training for 85 security personnel newly employed at the hospital, stated that the whole nation is under security threat, and as such, the hospital is not an exemption. He said although the hospital since his tenure in the office started had recorded no major security threat, the hospital was just being proactive by training its security personnel. He declared, “We have not had any major security threat, but they say that prevention is better and cheaper than cure. We do not want to wait until some incidents that occurred earlier on or that is occurring in other places to occur here before we start thinking of training our personnel to be professional.” JAMB should be scrapped – Asaju, ACU VC OOU inaugurates 3000-capacity ICT Building, others LASU VC, others explain motives for Ibile Day celebration Yale University to strengthen mental health education in… Professor Otegbayo charged the security operatives to always be courteous and professional in all their dealing at the hospital.
