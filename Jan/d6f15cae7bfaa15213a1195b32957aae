The Federal Government and governors of the South-West States have reached an agreement to develop a legal framework on the establishment of the regional security outfit, Amotekun. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo met with state governors and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who has declared the initiative illegal, was also at the meeting. The governors in the meeting, which took place in the Vice President’s office include the Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and his Ondo State counterpart, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, as well as the deputy governors of Lagos, Oyo and Ogun States. The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu was also in attendance. After the meeting, Governor Akeredolu said the meeting agreed on the way forward and a legal framework would be established to back the initiative.

Governors of South-West as you know, we were all there. “The meeting was presided over by the Vice President. The Honourable Attorney General of the Federation was there as well as the Inspector General of Police. “So, we have rubbed minds and all of us have agreed on the way forward. “The most important one is that we are going to have a legal framework to back this Amotekun. And this legal framework is going to be one which we all are going to look at and will be sure to go without any hindrance.” Asked whether that meant the establishment of Amotekun has been put on hold until the legal framework is developed, he answered: “No. What I believe is our resolution is that Amotekan is there.

In essence, really, is about community. “So, we are going to work together to see the community policing and Amotekan work in a way.” On the allegation of lack of consultation before its establishment, Akeredolu rejected the assertion saying: “No no no, there were consultations. Don’t say there were no consultations. There were consultations because, we held discussions with the IG then and what has developed is what has led to this, not that there were no consultations. “We just felt that with all these noises outside, it is better for us to sit down. “Remember that immediately the noise started, I said that we are going to explore political solution and all of us are here, my colleagues, the deputy governor of Oyo who is of the PDP, all of us are here. “So, we have looked at this solution to it now, both political and legal solutions to it and all of us will do it.” On the Federal Government’s attempt to stop the initiative, he said there was no such move. “No, the government is not trying to stop it. The attorney general has spoken on that. I’m sure you have all read the statement that he was misinterpreted. “So it’s so clear, there was no time that government wanted to stop Amotekun and the AGF having spoken, it’s all about us. So, there is no problem,” he declared. The Vice President’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, confirmed that agreement was reached, saying in a statement that: “Having regard to the need for all hands to be on deck in addressing the security concerns across the country, it was agreed that the structure of Amotekun should also align with the Community Policing strategy of the Federal Government. “It was also agreed that necessary legal instruments will be put in place by each of the states to give legal backing to the initiative and address all issues concerning the regulation of the security structure.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
