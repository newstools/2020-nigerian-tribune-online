The Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions have screened Dr Kingsley Obiora for the position of Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). During the screening, the committee urged him to bring his wealth of experience to bear in the task of assisting the Bank to achieve its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, among others. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Uba Sani stated this on Wednesday, January 29, 2020, while the committee grilled Dr Obiora, following the latter’s nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari for the position of Deputy Governor. Sen. Uba, who commended the nomination of Obiora as fitting, expressed confidence that the nominee was well suited for the position, bearing in mind the fact that he had been actively involved in the process of monetary policy formulation at both the national and international levels. According to him, the Senate, through the Committee, decided to give the screening expeditious consideration, given the sensitivity and critical role the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank plays in the nation’s economic sector and to close any gap that might be created with the imminent exit of the out-going Deputy Governor, Economic Policy. In their individual remarks, members of the Senate Committee lauded the competence of the nominee, noting that he possessed the expertise to add great value to the management of monetary policy and indeed the Nigerian economy.
