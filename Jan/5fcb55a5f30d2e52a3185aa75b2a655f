Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said on Saturday that his administration would be meeting with the management of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to discuss issues of compensation for victims of the January 19 pipeline fire in Abule Egba area of the state. Sanwo-Olu also said the government would be discussing with the corporation on measures to be taken in finding a lasting solution to incidence of pipeline vandalism in the state. The governor made this known while sympathising with over 300 displaced victims of the inferno who were resettled in Igando Emergency Relief Camp in Alimosho by the state government. It will be recalled that the governor was on a week-long working visit to the United Kingdom (UK) when the incident occurred, but his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, last Tuesday, led cabinet members and top government officials on a visit to the scene of the fire. According to Sanwo-Olu, the compensation plan would be extended to those whose properties were razed in the inferno, adding that some of the victims who rented homes in the area would also be supported to re-adjust to their normal lives.

We will also be looking at various forms of affordable accommodation for some of them who rent homes in the community. “We have taken enumeration and we know the status of each of the displaced families that are clustered in this relief camp. We will work with the records for the compensation and everyone of them will be re-integrated back to their community,” he said. Governor Sanwo-Olu, while describing the incident as a “regrettable disaster,” said the government felt the pain of the innocent victims who bore the losses of the pipeline vandalism. He said the state government took the step to resettle the victims at the Igando Relief Camp to ensure they were not left to their fate in their moments of despair, assuring that the victims would be catered for both medically and nutrition-wise for the period they would spend at the camp. “For the period the victims will be settled in the relief camp, we will ensure our responsibility both medically and nutrition-wise; we will take care of them until the coast is clear for them to return to their community,” the governor promised.
