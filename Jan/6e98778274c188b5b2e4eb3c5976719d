Joseph, the highly-acclaimed trans-atlantic story of self discovery; of one man’s quest to break social and cultural constraints; to find true identity, premieres in Lagos this January. The story trails the life of a young and successful medical doctor in the Caribbean whose drive to discover his roots takes him on a journey to parts unknown. Defiant and rebellious, Joseph dismisses the warnings and threats of his affluent family of cross-generational medical doctors to seek a reconnection to his roots and his purpose. Joseph surveys the central character’s journey to his land of origin, regaling viewers with tales of love, acceptance and freedom; upending universal misconceptions about his people; himself awed by the many things that have remained unchanged between his two peoples in spite of generations of separation across continents.
