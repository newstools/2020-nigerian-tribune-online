The Federal Government on Tuesday inaugurated the Governing Board of the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS) with a charge to immediate proffer solution to the rising insecurity in Nigeria. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, inaugurated the Board which has the former Director-General of State Security Service (SSS), A.A Gadzama, as chairman. He said the inauguration of the NISS Board could not have come at a better time than now when security has become a major issue for national discourse. “It is hoped that this, coupled with the fact that security is one of the cardinal objectives of the present administration, will spur you on to make a success of this national assignment,” he said.
