Many have nurtured a long time based conviction to rather commit suicide than to face humiliation. No humiliation is eternal; it is temporal. Do we still think that our present difficulty is the worst of all? Do we have it up our memory that we can’t get over our hard times?  No, it’s high time we free ourselves from this emotional struggles and frustrations. If suicide is to die only, what is now the barrier, the pity and the sermon? Since, we know and had already conditioned our mind that death is sacrosanct and inevitable. Perhaps, either we make it suicidal or not, we have to meet our demise. But, do we ever think and reflect on the internal and external pains this might cause our families, friends and of course the beloved ones? Suicide is not death; it is an atrocity. It kills hope, destiny, fortune, glory, expectations, knowledge and wisdom. How do you sacrifice these wonderful things for an atrocity? To die of a natural cause is something; it’s honorary. But to commit suicide attracts questions, condemnation and social sympathy. Suicide is endemic; it’s trending. It has caused us more adversities and degeneration. We can’t be too cautious of reeling out this challenge of functional disorder which has been the order of our interim society, nation and the world at large.

Suicide is not an option even at the whistle minute. Pain and misery are part of life even when you are born with a silver spoon, you will unavoidably taste the pile. But many do not know or understand the concept of hope again. I call it atrocity because of the cruelty and effect on others. Is it that we have lost our hope? Is it true that the world is not worthy of living? These, I ask myself frequently and I have concluded that when there is life, there is hope Since most suicidal cases can’t independently work out the disability of human minds by anatomical, psychological and medical therapeutic measures, it is only right, as concerned citizens, that we are vigilant and make constant awareness to rein in this anomaly before it is too late. Studies have shown that suicidal victims execute their intentions after series of warning signals like moodiness, self-harmful behaviors, sudden calmness, incessant drugs and alcohol and dashing away prized possessions among others. It is the responsibility of all of us to be our neignour’s keeper by watching for such signs. Adeyemi, Abdulganeey Abiola, Ilorin  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
