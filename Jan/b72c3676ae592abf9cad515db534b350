The Special Adviser on Education to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Dr Joseph Odemuyiwa, on Monday, claimed that all his educational certificates are real and authentic. Odemuyiwa was one of the newly sworn-in aides of Abiodun. An online media outfit (name withheld) had over the weekend alleged Odemuyiwa of being a “serial certificate forger and manipulator, who fraudulently walked his way to the top of the academia despite being discovered and dismissed by two higher institutions.” Speaking with newsmen in his office, Odemuyiwa, said he had nothing to hide as far as his certificates are concerned. “Let it be known that I have every certificate and qualification that I claim. I am very proud of my educational path. I am not surprised there may be individuals who might not understand how I ended up becoming a university lecturer. The certificates I claimed are real and authentic,” he added.

The former National President of the Association of Business School Educators of Nigeria (ABEN), said he was never booted out of any of the universities he worked for forged certificates. On his professorial status, Odemuyiwa submitted that his professorial chair was endowed by Mukthar Al-Ameen Endowed For Pitman Education and Training between the period of 2014-2017. He said: “My professorial was not the one recommended by Otunba Gbenga Daniel. I occupied an endowment professorial chair meant for Pitman Education and Training in London by the University of Malaysia. “We call it Muktar-Ameen Endowed Professorial Chair; it was endowed for Pitman and Pitman appointed me for the chair. That was why it was just for three years and I left office.” He said he had sought legal advice from his lawyers on the published news item against his person. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
