The inside of the nose is full of tiny, delicate blood vessels that can become damaged and bleed relatively easily. Nosebleeds are fairly common and most people will experience them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect: children between two and 10 years of age, elderly people, pregnant women, people who regularly take aspirin or anticoagulants, such as warfarin, people with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia. Common causes of nosebleeds include: picking your nose, blowing your nose very hard. a minor injury to your nose, changes in humidity or temperature like the ongoing harmattan. This causes the inside of the nose to become dry and cracked. Things you can do to prevent nosebleeds include: avoid picking your nose and keep your fingernails short, blow your nose as little as possible and only very gently and keep your daughter’s nose lubricated with Vaseline especially during the harmattan period. Nosebleeds aren›t usually serious. However, frequent or heavy nosebleeds may indicate more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure or a blood clotting disorder, and should be checked through a visit to your doctor.
