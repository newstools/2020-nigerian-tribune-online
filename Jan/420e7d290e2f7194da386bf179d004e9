AS the Federal Government concludes plans to reopen the Akanu Ibiam International Airport before the Easter celebrations, after its upgrade, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has successfully installed a brand new Category 2 Instrument Landing System / Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) to replace the old system which was installed 17 years ago. Already, a successful site acceptance test on the equipment has been conducted by NAMA engineers in Enugu in preparation for its calibration in the coming days. Equally, in a bid to address communication blind spots in the Lagos South East corridor, the agency has installed a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) for satellite communication at the airport. This SATCOM (Satellite Communication) node, according to the agency, has further been integrated into the national satellite communication network which is linked to the  African Indian Ocean SATCOM Network (AFISNET).

Speaking on the gains of this latest installation, the Managing Director of NAMA, Captain Fola Akinkuotu, who noted with delight that radio communication along the Lagos South East sector has “improved tremendously,” said the installation of the VHF radio in Enugu is “particularly significant, as the city is strategically located to accommodate over six routes, both local and international.” “Enugu being on a higher latitude can cover for Manfe entry/exit reporting point in Cameroun for international flights like Ethiopian, Rwanda Airlines, Kenya Airways, South Africa Airways and the like,” Akinkuotu said. The NAMA boss revealed that the new installation has provided  Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN) link that would enhance effective data communication for transmission of flight plans, NOTAMs and Aeronautical Communication messages, just as it has provided effective coordination between Enugu tower and Lagos Area Control Centre through the ATS/DS (Air Traffic Services/ Direct Speech) for departing and arriving traffic ahead of time.
