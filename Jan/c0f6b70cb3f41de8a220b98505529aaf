Oyo State governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday, questioned the premise upon which Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, declared the Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed “Operation Amotekun” as illegal. Speaking with journalists after a two-hour closed-door meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo at his Abeokuta residence, Makinde said he expected Malami to focus on his duties to advise President Muhammadu Buhari on legal issues rather than make such proclamation on Amotekun. Maintaining that Amotekun was only established to complement the strides of regular security agencies, Makinde said he’ll rather describe Malami’s declaration as a circulation on social media that was not official. “You don’t run the government on social media. If I see a letter or get a call from the AGF telling me what you just said (that Amotekun is illegal), then it will be a different kind of reaction. Amotekun has come to stay ― Soyinka Amotekun is our right to life ― Yomi Alliyu Don’t back out of Amotekun security initiative, NANS… Ondo farmers kick as FG declares Amotekun security outfit… ALSO READ: Don’t back out of Amotekun security initiative, NANS urges SouthWest govs “I have been reading it just like you on the social media and I have nothing official to that effect. “Besides, I don’t think for a country like Nigeria, the Attorney General will wake up and make his own laws. “He may interpret and advise the President if there are legal issues but I haven’t seen anything that gave that power to the Attorney General to make such declaration,” Makinde said. On his mission at Obasanjo’s residence, Makinde said the visit was in wishing the former president a happy new year and a great year ahead.
