Renowned criminologist, Professor Adeyinka Aderinto described ‘sheer negligence of social roles to Nigeria’s youthful populace’ as a major cause of ravaging insecurity in the country. Professor Aderinto who was the immediate past Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), University of Ibadan and current Head of Department of Sociology stated this while delivering the 482 inaugural lecture of the University titled “On the Fringe of the Society”, on Thursday. Aderinto disclosed that Nigerian youths have been left on the fringe by those who should nurture and cater to them and are now fighting back. According to Aderinto, the pain of youths have become compounded by widespread poverty, unemployment and economic problems which continue to characterise the Nigerian State.

The criminologist advised government at all levels to reduce the overwhelming emphasis on wealth as a symbol of success in Nigeria as this has become reasons many youths take to crime and criminality. According to him, “Efforts should be made by the federal and state governments to reduce the overwhelming emphasis on wealth as a symbol of success in our country. “Many of our youths now associate success with owning several houses and cars making them unable to come to terms with leaving a less-glamorous life. “The rapid socialisation and nurturance functions which the family and school are supposed to perform are becoming difficult as rapid urbanisation, widespread poverty and economic problems continue to characterise the Nigerian Situation. “Today, due to the sheer negligence of social roles to our youthful populace, they have been pushed to the Fringe. They are now fighting back,” he stated. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
