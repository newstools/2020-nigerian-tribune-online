According to him, ” We will continue to give back to this school because we all pass through here years ago and we are proud of this. We are the first set and it is necessary for us to set the pace for other old students to follow suit and come back to assist the school.” While revealing that government should not be left alone in the education sector, he called on the state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi to ensure more teachers are recruited for primary and secondary schools across the state. Responding, the school Principal, Mrs Modupe Adelabu commended the pioneer alumni for the gesture, advising other old students to look back and contribute to the uplifting of the school.
