In addition, they will discuss issues around how the new Act affects the Value Added Tax (VAT), Companies Income Tax Act (CITA), Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), Petroleum Profit Tax Act (PPTA), Capital Gains Tax Act (CGTA), Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) and Stamps Duties Act (SDA). It would be recalled that in 2018, the Nigerian government set in motion an amendment to the existing fiscal policy in the country. A major highlight of the review was the value-added tax, which by the 2019 Act has been reviewed upwards to 7.5% from 5%. Although the enactment of the Act has generated some criticism among Nigerians, the government had maintained that the new Act would serve the country well in terms of its fiscal administration in the long run. The 2019 Financial Act seeks to promote fiscal equity, align domestic laws with global best practices and support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The provisions of the policy will also increase government revenues and stakeholders’ investments in capital and investment market through the introduction of incentives. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
