An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court in Ekiti State has dissolved a 26-year-old marriage between Adewale Florence and her husband, Sunday. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) their marriage was dissolved on grounds of lack of care for her and the children, constant beating, threat to her life through charms and desertion for 11 years. Florence told the court that she left her husband 11 years ago because of constant beating, threat to life and lack of care. She told the court that her husband had failed to perform his responsibility and had not been taking care of his children. The mother of four told the court that at times, her husband put charms in her wardrobe.

The respondent, Sunday, had repeatedly shunned the court proceedings, saying that he was not interested in the matter at all as he had remarried. The court president, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, noted that their marriage had broken down irretrievably, and consequently dissolved the marriage. Akomolede ruled that since the children have come of age, except the youngest, they can decide whether to remain with their father or mother. She also ordered that the respondent should pay N5,000 monthly their last child’s feeding allowance. She said both parties should be responsible for the education of their children.
