Aragbaye explained that the state government had also approved 33 per cent for those who retired before 2014 and peculiar allowances for some workers. Responding on behalf of the workers, the NLC chairman, Sunday Adeleye and his counterpart from TUC, Helen Odofin, appreciated the state’s government for regular payment of salaries and allowances since the administration came on board in 2017. The labour leaders, however, appealed to the state government not to sack or retrench workers in the state under any disguise and solicited for recruitment of more workers in the state’s civil service.
