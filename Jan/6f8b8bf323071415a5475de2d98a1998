The minister explained that research institutes would now avail their research equipment and findings to the universities so as to enhance academic excellence and outputs. He said increased funding for researchers in the agencies will discourage Nigerians from patronising imported herbs as Nigerians have more than enough herbal resources that are lying fallow. Earlier, the Executive Secretary, TETFUND, Mr Elias Sulaiman Gungoro said that the Federal Government released N5 billion last year to his agency to fund research and expressed hope that the grant will be increased to further enable it to intensify on funding research. He also said that Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is the nerve centre for developed nations and for Nigeria to achieve development, STEM subjects must be embraced by students and researchers.
