President Buhari had formally announced the new development on his Twitter handle on Monday, after signing the 2020 Finance Bill into law. The Value Added Tax in the country had been 5% but once the new law becomes effective, VAT in Nigeria will become 7.5%. Nigeria’s Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed while explaining the new VAT stated that the move is necessary to make more money available for the government, most especially the state government to enable them to pay workers the newly approved minimum wage of #30,000. Nigerians, however, took to Twitter to express their views on the new increase, see the reactions below: ALSO READ: Kwara bans religious preachings in public schools Average VAT rate in most European counties is around 20-25%. You might argue that Nigeria is different. But 7.5% VAT in Nigeria is great. It helps government raise revenue needed for infrastructure. Accountability and judicious use of raised VAT is another issue entirely. — Dr. Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) January 14, 2020       Meeting with Buhari: ASUU demands declaration of 5-year… NUT to meet Buhari over 65-year retirement age for teachers New VAT rate takes off as Buhari signs Finance Bill into law Buhari condoles with Niger over terrorist attack                  STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
