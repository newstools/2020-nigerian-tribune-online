Disturbed by the renewed cases of deadly attacks in states including Plateau and Taraba, and elsewhere, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has called for the re-valuation and re-calibration of the nation’s security architecture. In a statement issued by Paul Ibe, his media adviser, in Abuja on Tuesday, Atiku expressed the view that the attacks were a reminder that much work remained to be done as “we still have ahead of us to tidy the country’s internal security apparatus.” He appreciated the military and other security outfits “for their spirited efforts to clear all trenches of bandits hideouts, it is expedient that we re-evaluate and recalibrate the country’s security architecture through community policing and any other of such mechanisms that allow for a more far-reaching inclusive security networking.” The former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, added: “While it is desirable to have a razor edge security system, it is also important that we ensure that the justice system in the country works, so as to ensure that criminals who are caught in this kind of heinous crime are meted with adequate punishments.

So, there is no deterrence to such crimes. Justice is thus key to promoting peace in our communities. “If you give people the confidence that anyone who breaks the law will be found and made to face the full wrath of the law, then people will be less inclined to promote violence and the killings that come with it.” He condoled with the families bereaved as a result of the attacks as he prayed for the peaceful repose of their souls.
