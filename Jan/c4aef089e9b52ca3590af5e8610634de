It was a case of love turning sour when a boyfriend simply called Solomon, a student of Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi allegedly stabbed his live-in lover, late Patience Zakkari, to death over a minor disagreement between them. One of the friends of the love birds who simply called herself Vasty narrated that the two lovebirds have been living together for some times now to the extent that people use to call them husband and wife considering the level of their relationship. She added that on Friday, the late Patience on her way back to the house at the Students Village passed through the small gate and while trying to go, she came across another male student who accosted her and started chatting with her against her wish. Vasty further narrated that the boyfriend who was heading to the campus to look for her met them at the small gate and started insulting and calling her names, a development that upset her while she just walked away from the scene to the house.
