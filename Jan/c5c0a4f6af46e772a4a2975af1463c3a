The Chairman of the Task Force and the state Commissioner for Environment, Dr Kabir Getso, gave the warning after monitoring the monthly environmental sanitation in Kano on Saturday. Getso, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mr Hussam Khury, decried the nonchalance of residents in complying to the January exercise.
