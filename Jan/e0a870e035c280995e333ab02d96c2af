He appealed to the government to establish and strengthen the local vigilantes which according to him have the commitment and competence to deal with security infractions within their communities. He lamented at the frequent killings and kidnapping of Tawari people even in their homes and on the farms with consequences of the payment of humongous ransom and in some cases killing of the victims for failing to meet their demands adding that the 2nd January 2020 attack was the climax of the gruesome murders of his people. The traditional ruler of the community thanked the governor for his quick response to the crisis.
