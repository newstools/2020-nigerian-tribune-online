The Senate, on Thursday, resolved to probe the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) over the sum of $396 million expended on turn-around Maintenance of refineries between 2013 and 2015. The upper legislative chamber also mandated the Committee on Petroleum Downstream, Upstream and Gas to carry out a holistic investigation on the turn-around maintenance expenditures and the current state of these refineries. The Senate also resolved that a stakeholders conference should be convoked to enable key industry players to bare their minds on adoptable measures to bring the nation’s four refineries back in-stream and operating at full capacity. Senate resolution to investigate spendings on the maintenance of refineries by the Corporation came about after deliberation on the motion brought to the floor by Senator Yusuf A. Yusuf (APC, Taraba Central). The lawmaker noted that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has four refineries, two in Port-Harcourt (PHRC) and one each in Kaduna (KRPC) and Warri (WRPC).

He recalled: “The country, through NNPC, has in the past 25 years spent Billion of US dollars in Turn-Around Maintenance of the refineries, the latest being over $396 million spent between 2013 and 2015 without meaningful result.” The lawmaker lamented that “the refineries have remained in moribund state in the last 15-20 years and is almost reaching total collapse due to lack of proposer maintenance of the facilities with a poor average capacity utilization hovering between fifteen per cent and twenty-five per cent per annum.” Senator Yusuf said, “despite the huge spending on turn-around Maintenance of refineries, NNPC recently announced a cumulative loss of N123.25 billion in 10 months (January to October 2019), putting the total revenue of facilities at N68.82 billion, while total expenses incurred was N192.1 billion within the same period.” He warned that “such huge wastage and slippages amidst the nation’s tight economy, if not addressed, may lead the country back to recession.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
