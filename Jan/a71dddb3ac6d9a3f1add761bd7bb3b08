President Muhammadu Buhari has reaffirmed the commitment of his administration to use technology for enhanced public service delivery.  He gave the commitment in State House, Abuja, on Thursday, while receiving the leadership of Computer Professionals Registration Council of Nigeria (CPCN) and Nigeria Computer Society (NCS) led by its president, Prof. Charles Uwadia. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity), quoted him as saying that ‘‘technology in public service delivery is no longer a luxury, but a pressing necessity.’’ Noting that Information Technology is the driving force for social and economic change, the President told the IT professionals that his Government, through its actions, has demonstrated its commitment to convert these potentials to reality. ‘‘The future belongs to IT. What was unimaginable 20 years ago is a reality today. Accordingly, we have introduced numerous policies and have made substantial investments to ensure the benefits of this technology-driven age is felt by 200 million Nigerians.
