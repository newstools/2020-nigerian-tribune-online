With Lassa fever hitting some states in the country, the Oyo State government has warned bushmeat lovers to be cautious by ensuring such meat is well cooked before consumption. This is as government enjoined residents of the state, especially food producers, to be wary of drying food items by the roadside which exposes such items to rodents infestation. The State Commissioner for Health, Dr Bashir Bello, who sounded these warnings during a press conference held at State Secretariat, Ibadan, on Thursday, further enjoined residents to properly keep their food items in their homes and prevent rats and other rodents from feasting on them. Though he pointed out that there was no outbreak of Lassa fever in the state, Bello said the state had set health facilities and medical personnel on the alert to be able to carry out a quick diagnostic evaluation of Lassa.
