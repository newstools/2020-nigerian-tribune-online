A passenger has petitioned the Minister of Aviation, HadiSirika and the management of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) over the alleged maltreatment of Nigeria bound passengers flying on Air France. In a letter sent to the Minister and NCAA, the passenger explained how an Abuja bound Air France flight AF878  from Charles De Gaulle, on December 29, 2019, took a detour to Chad without informing the passengers at the point of ticket purchase or even planning of trips.

Most of the passengers were coming from different countries and were supposed to proceed to further destinations in Nigeria to be able to spend the new year but could not do so with some missing their business meetings over what they described as Air France negligence and shabby treatment of Nigerians. “Up till now, some passengers have not recovered their missing luggage. This is also in addition to the fact that most of the time, Air France deliberately assigns old aircraft for the Nigerian leg of the journey as they did in November 2019. Time has come for the aviation authorities to investigate these shabby treatment of Nigerian inbound and outbound passengers from Charles De Gaulle Airport. Minister, Kindly do something about it please,” the passenger pleaded. STAY STRONGER, LONGER AND SATISFY MADAM LIKE NEVER BEFORE WITH THIS NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS. CLICK NOW.
