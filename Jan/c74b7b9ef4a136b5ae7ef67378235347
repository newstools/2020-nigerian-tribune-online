The Federal Government will not stop Nigerians from travelling to China or any other country where Coronavirus has manifested. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made this known while addressing newsmen shortly after a  meeting of the inter-ministerial and multi-sectoral committee on coronavirus held at the Ministry of Health, Abuja on Friday. He said that rather than impose a travel ban, there will be travel advisory that will help Nigerians who wish to visit China to do so without any encumbrances to their health and wellbeing. “We know it is a bit difficult to ban people from travelling.

We need to let people who travel know that there is a need for absolute transparency and absolute honesty when they are filling out forms. “Some people don’t take the forms seriously and they do mislead authorities when they are asked to declare their status. “One of the major advantages of the declaration of global emergency for coronavirus by WHO is that they understand that combating it can be really expensive and there are states that cannot afford it. “But there are partners that can help such countries. But right now, we are in the stage of working together inter-ministerially to make sure we address the epidemic,” he said.
