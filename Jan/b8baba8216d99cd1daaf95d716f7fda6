She said: “We are paying attention to quality assurance and not just the rhetoric of inspecting schools. Some of our local government areas have already gotten motorboats in order for them to be able to go to schools in riverine areas.” She continued: “When we discovered that the major challenge of accessing schools in rural areas was motorable roads, we decided in collaboration with the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) to procure motorbikes. This is just the first phase. More motorcycles are coming.” The SUBEB boss disclosed that the governor had already committed other resources in order to help all the workers in the LGEAs across the state to be able to do their work based on their performance index. She assured that the state government is determined to turn around the fortunes of basic education in the state by giving quality education to school children, the future leaders of the country.
