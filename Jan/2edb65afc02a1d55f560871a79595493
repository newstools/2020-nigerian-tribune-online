The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said that “the damning” 2019 corruption index report on Nigeria by Transparency International (TI) has further validated its position that corruption has worsened under President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement issued in Abuja by Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary, the main opposition party maintained that it is a national embarrassment that “under an administration by the same leader who wears the medal as ‘African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion,’ and whose government boasts of zero-tolerance for corruption, our nation now ranks as fourth most corrupt country in West African and one of the leading most corrupt countries of the world.” The PDP noted: “The TI report, which shows Nigeria dropping to a malodorous 26, from the already disapproving 27 points it maintained since 2017, had further exposed the Buhari administration and the APC as merely posturing as saints and hounding innocent Nigerians with fake anti-corruption war, while engaged in unprecedented looting of our national resources.

The only thing left for them is to apologize to Nigerians and get ready for their place in the dustbin of history as the worst government and political party ever in the history of our nation.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
