The Supreme Court, on Monday, upheld the elections of Aminu Tambuwal, Abdullahi Ganduje, Simon Lalong and Bala Mohammed as Governors of Sokoto, Kano, Plateau and Bauchi States respectively. The apex court, in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants, in the case of Sokoto failed to prove allegations made against the election that returned Tambuwal as Governor of the State. The All Progressive Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, had approached the apex court to set aside the concurrent judgments of the state governorship election petition tribunal and the Court of Appeal which upheld the election of Tambuwal and declared him the winner of the Sokoto governorship election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the Sokoto governorship election, having won majority of votes cast.
