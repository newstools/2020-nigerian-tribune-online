Titilope Baptist-Sanusi popularly known as “Baptista” in the music industry has released two emotional strong friendship songs titled ‘ORE BI JESU’ and the sovereign provisions of our sufficient God. Ore bi Jesu is a Yoruba traditional song infused with an ancient hymn “No One Ever Cares For Me Like Jesus.” “Sufficient God, on the other hand, is a personal experience I had with my father on his promise never to leave nor forsake me, and how I was surprised by God every single time the needs arise,” Baptista said. “I fell in love with the first verse of the song “no leniyan” after my father woke up one morning and started singing the song, I wonder why he sings the song, but I fell in love with the song, knowing fully well how God has been with me even before my birth, to add to this. Also, my delivery was a miracle. He was, he is and will always be a true friend. “No one ever cares for me” is a hymnal song that came immediately as I thought of doing a song on “no leniyan.” I never came across the song until one day I heard the song at the MFM tent maker rehearsal, I then fell so in love with the song. That was how I wrote the songs together.

I have done other songs from 2016 to 2020. I know your question would be why it took me as long as 4years to release the song. I know its just the divine orchestration of God for the song to be out this year. Our father in the lord Dr D.K. Olukoya prophesied that this year is the year of Spiritual revival and New glory. I sat, and the holy spirit ministered to me that this is the year for the song. I checked the hymnal song “no one ever cares for me” in the MFM hymn book which I have never done since 2016 I got the inspiration, it happens to be under Evangelism, then I knew that this is the year for the song because it has been said that this year is the year of Spiritual revival. We need to do Evangelism that no person can truly love us other than Jesus! (Proverbs 18:24) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
