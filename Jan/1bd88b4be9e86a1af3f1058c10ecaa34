Security, they say, is everybody’s responsibility. No doubt, the Federal Government of Nigeria has been doing its best in ensuring that lives and properties are secured, but in a situation where there are inadequacies, I think the government at state and local levels should step in to complement the activities of security apparatus already on ground. Amotekun is similar to the security guards established by some states in the North to complement the activities of security agencies set up by the Federal Government. For instance, in Kano State, we have ‘Yan Shitet’ performing the role of security agency; ‘Yan Tawuri’ with dogs just like Odua Peoples Congress in the South-West performing the roles of security agents in Kaduna State. Similarly, in Kastina State, we have ‘Hisbah group’ complementing the responsibility of police. Let me say categorically that when it comes to security, we do not have to be tribal or political because lives and properties are involved, and we should be able to do everything possible to secure ourselves. It is paramount to accept the fact that safety breeds growth, development and stability. As a country, we cannot be doing things the same way and expect different result; rather, our approach to issues has to be revisited to foster new results. ‘Amotekun’ should be supported by the Federal Government. Government should not  sabotage the people’s effort to  bring into fruition this good initiative.

However, the United Nations recommend one police officer for every four citizens, and to effectively fight crime, Nigeria needs extra 150,000 policemen in five- years which for now is quite challenging for the Federal Government to meet up with. Hence, there is a need for complementary outfits like Amotekun is sacrosanct. The lack of effective security has led to the death of bread winners of some families, increased dependency ratio, loss of manpower, increased rate of widow and orphans in our society. Therefore, the need not to fold our arms but to restrategize to curb this nefarious act in our society is a panacea to national development.
