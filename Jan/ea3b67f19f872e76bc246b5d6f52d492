The Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu has raised the alarm over activities of fake recruitment syndicate using social media to invite candidates to apply for non-existing vacancies at the Federal Ministry of Education. He said the Federal Ministry of Education he supervises is not recruiting, urging the public to disregard any such fake recruitment advertisement being circulated on the social media. He spoke while briefing newsmen on Friday in Abuja, in his reaction to media reports that the Ministry was employing graduate teachers into its schools.

Adamu said, by law, the Ministry cannot and does not employ any officer above grade level six (GL.06), adding that it is the exclusive preserve of the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) to do so. For the avoidance of doubt “the last time the Federal Civil Service Commission recruited teachers for the Nations Unity Schools was in 2018” the Minister said. Explaining the rationale for the briefing, Adamu Adamu said some fraudsters have opened websites advertising for recruitment into the Ministry, adding that it is a complete scam and that members of the public should avoid being victims. “Whenever recruitment is to be done into the Ministry, the Federal Civil Service Commission will advertise through its mechanism, following all due processes before posting successful officers to the Ministry,” Adamu Adamu reiterated.
