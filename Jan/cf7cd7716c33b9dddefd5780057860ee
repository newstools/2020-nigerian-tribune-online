Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Saturday, reaffirmed his administration’s plan to transform the educational sector of the state, vowing to increase government’s investment for the good of the pupils.  Over 3000 teachers from various schools and education districts across the state converged at De Blue Roof of the Lagos Television, Ikeja, where the Governor Sanwo-Olu formally launched the EKOEXCEL, a teachers’ professional development and training programme. Teachers from primary school across the state had earlier gone through a 2 weeks training process, organised by the State Universal Basic Education Board (LSUBEB) to increase their capacity and develop their manpower. Sanwo-Olu noted that at the end, over 14,000 primary school teachers would have benefited from the initiative while over 500,000 pupils would have been positively impacted. “I am particularly happy that this programme is holding at a time when all hands are on deck to ensure that the quality of teaching and learning is improved across all our schools in the state.

The governor said the state government would, in a bid to encourage teachers and make good examples from outstanding ones, identify the best Head Teachers in all the 20 LGs and 37 LCDAs and reward them with a car each. He assured that his administration was not paying lip service to the repositioning of the educational sector, noting that it was the reason the education ministry got a significantly higher envelope in the 2020 Budget. Sanwo-Olu also promised that teachers would undergo free sight assessment, adding that reading glasses would be provided for every teacher that required it to be able to discharge their duties effectively. EKOEXCEL, which is Excellence in Child Learning and Education Programme, is a Lagos State primary education transformation initiative. It is targeted to move over 14,000 Head Teachers and teachers from analogue to digital teaching, using tablets and updated curriculum. Over 3,000 primary school teachers from 300 public primary schools have been captured under the Pilot Scheme. An initiative of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, the EKOEXCEL is aimed at developing a highly-skilled teaching workforce by training, supporting and motivating Lagos State teachers to succeed in the classroom of tomorrow and enhance the State Basic Education curriculum thereby empowering children to compete effectively in the world of work. The programme will equip teachers with skills to deliver value, empower pupils with the requisite knowledge to improve education and help in sustaining the growth of Lagos State as a leading knowledge-driven city and economy in the world.
