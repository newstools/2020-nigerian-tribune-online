Kwara State government on Wednesday said that soft loans would soon be extended to transport workers like motorcycle, tricycle and cab drivers who have been affected by the shutdown to flatten the curve of transmission of COVID-19. In a statement after a virtual state executive council meeting to drive home its call for social distancing at a time of global COVID-19 pandemic, the government, through the chief press secretary to Kwara State governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, said such loans, to be paid back after the COVID crisis is over, would come under the state’s social investment programme to help the drivers cope with the shutdowns. The government, which commended the Kwara State Technical Committee on COVID-19 for the “good work they have been doing for our people,” urged all cabinet members to also join community advocacy to deepen public enlightenment without compromising public safety. GovernorAbdulrahman  AbdulRazaq said Kwara may soon receive donations from Abuja which would strengthen the palliatives for the masses — and beyond the categories currently receiving palliatives. Deputy Governor and Chairman of the Technical Committee, Kayode Alabi, said Kwara has emerged as one of the most prepared states in Nigeria for the pandemic, citing the state of its facilities, the readiness and commitment of its manpower, and the steady distribution of palliatives to the poor to lessen the impact of the development. The teleconference was attended by all members of the cabinet from their various locations, with Governor Abdulrazaq saying such non-physical interaction offered a glimpse into what would happen in the future.
