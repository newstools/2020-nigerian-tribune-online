Governor Seyi Makinde has announced that the number of positive cases of coronavirus has increased to 15, with two more tests coming back positive on Friday. He disclosed that the two cases came from the ongoing mass testing exercise being done at Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan. With less than 100 tests done so far, Makinde said the ongoing mass testing and its results would enable the state know the pattern of the virus and take appropriate measures. He also announced the resolve of the state to increase isolation centres with focus on the state hospitals in Ogbomoso, Saki and Igboora. Meanwhile, the reopening of state secretariat has been shifted by one more week, with Monday April 27 set as new resumption date for civil servants. He maintained that even the new date was subject to further extension depending on the COVID-19 (coronavirus ) situation in the state. On palliatives, Makinde said distribution was yet to start because the data met on ground will make palliatives to fall into the wrong hands. He, however, said the state had now developed its own data that will ensure that only the poorest of the poor get the palliatives.
