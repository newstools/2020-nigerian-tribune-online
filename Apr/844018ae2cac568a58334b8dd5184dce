Crude oil prices, on Friday, rose above $30 per barrel as oil producers from the OPEC+ coalition are discussing the possibility of slashing global crude oil production by 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in cooperation with producers from outside the group, a source with OPEC told Reuters. The rise in crude oil prices came a day after US President Donald Trump said he had a fruitful conversation with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Putin of Russia. A final figure up for discussion would depend on the outcome of the meeting of President Trump with US oil firms later on Friday and over the weekend, Reuters’ source said.
