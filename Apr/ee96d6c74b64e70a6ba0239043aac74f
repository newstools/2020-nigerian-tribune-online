Okundia said: “The new isolation centre boasts of 28-bed capacity, with two large wards and up to about four private wards. The centre has been ready for operationalisation about three or four weeks now. The only thing is that no patient is here yet and currently, all the personnel are undergoing facility training.” He said the state government will be using the Stella Obasanjo Hospital and Ogbe Nursing Home as holding centre for coronavirus patients who do not have any symptoms but have tested positive. On the two new suspected coronavirus cases in the state, he said they are waiting for information from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to commence contact tracing. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
