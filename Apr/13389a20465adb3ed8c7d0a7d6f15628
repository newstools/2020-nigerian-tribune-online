On why the NGO did not embark on the distribution itself, the FaCePam Director said that “you know it is a common purse so we decided to contribute to it hoping that government will get them across to the beneficiaries”. While receiving the contribution, state deputy governor Sen Baba Tela who is Chairman of the State Rapid Response Taskforce on COVID-19 and Lassa fever commended the NGO for the donation saying that it will go a long way to augment what the government is doing. Baba Tela assured that the items will be merged with the ones earlier donated by other organisations and individuals and thereafter decide on how to judiciously distribute them. The items donated by FaCePam include bags of rice, maize, beans as well as Jerrycans of palm oil, red oil and other consumables. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
