Some bandits on Tuesday afternoon invaded Karaukarau village in Giwa Local government Area of Kaduna State and kidnapped three nursing mothers. A resident of the area, Sani Bakali, told Tribune Online that the bandits came to the village on Tuesday afternoon during a wedding ceremony. “You know the curfew imposed as a result of the coronavirus had not been easy for the bandits as they now have short supplies of food. The hoodlums now attack wedding venues and gathering. “On this day, there was a wedding in our village and the bandits came to the venue and took away 13 women,” he said. He disclosed that when the villagers heard of the situation, they mobilised and confronted the bandits, leading to the rescue of 10 of the women while three nursing mothers were taken away. As of the time of filing this report, the three women are still under their captivity. According to Bakali, they have reported the attack to the divisional police in Giwa local government. When contacted, the police image-maker, ASP Muhammad Jalige, said the command is yet to get information about the attack.
