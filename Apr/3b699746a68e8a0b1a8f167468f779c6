LOVE for beer has cost a 24-year-old woman of Garden Township in Lusaka, Zambia, her marriage of three years. Her husband, Moses Mwakapiya, 36, says he has given up on his wife, Agness Mambwe, because she has defied his order to stop drinking beer. According to the Daily Mail of Zambia, he was testifying in a matter in which Mambwe sued him for marriage reconciliation. The couple got married in 2017 and has one child. Mwakapiya told the court that he no longer loves Mambwe because she has defied his instructions on several occasions. “We have sat down on several occasions to counsel Mambwe to stop drinking beer but she has not changed. I am tired of her behaviour and I don’t think I can continue staying with her,” he said. Mwakapiya told the court that he always finds the children alone when he comes back from work. He said Mambwe has neglected her duties because of her love for beer.
