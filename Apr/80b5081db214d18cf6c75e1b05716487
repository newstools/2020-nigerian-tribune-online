Violence against women and girls is a grave violation of human rights. ”Its impact ranges from immediate to long-term multiple physical, sexual and mental consequences for women and girls, including death. It negatively affects the victim’s general well-being and prevents such women from fully participating in society. ”Violence not only has negative consequences for women but also their families, the community and the country at large,” Tijani said. The association also commended the coalition of human rights civil society organisations for the prompt action in coming to the aid of the victim in order to justice for her. He restated the commitment of NMA to partner with Governments, civil society organizations and other institutions to advocate for ending violence against women and girl-child. He added the partnership would increase awareness of the causes and consequences of violence and build the capacity of partners to prevent and respond to violence. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
