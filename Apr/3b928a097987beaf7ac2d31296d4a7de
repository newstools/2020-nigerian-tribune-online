The team sighted the fire and approached to find out the cause and render assistance.” It further explained that prompted some mischief makers alledged that the Navy Team set the shop on fire in order to create bad image for the service and the Armed Forces. According to the statement, “however, while the fire was still raging, an investigation team from the Naval Base, along with the Department of State Service in Ondo State, visited the scene of the incident and discovered a camp gas with pot on it and a gallon close by. It was obvious the shop owner was cooking at that time of the incident and an inflammable substance (either kerosene or PMS) inside the gallon was close by. “The spot inspection and estimate showed that, in the process of running out , the shop owner might have inadvertently tripped the naked flame from the cooking gas which triggered the fire incident, in addition, the wooden structure of the building aided the inferno,” It, therefore, appealed to the general public to disregard the false information being circulated.
