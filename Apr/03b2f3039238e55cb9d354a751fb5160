Worried by the people’s attitude towards adherence to the measures against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by the people of the state, Bauchi State government has warned that it may be forced to impose a lockdown in the state unless the situation changes positively. The state Deputy Governor, Senator Baba Tela, while briefing newsmen on Monday at the Government House, said people of the state had refused to come to terms with the existence of the pandemic in the state. “It is sad that people of the state are not observing the social distancing practice, they are not washing their hands, they are not using hand sanitizers and they are not abiding by the preventive measures put in place by the government,” the deputy governor said. The deputy governor, who is also the Chairman of the State Rapid Response Task Force, lamented over a situation where people still leave in denial of the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “imagine people posting on the social media that the infection is sickness of the wealthy and other insinuations, this is unacceptable to government. “After he was briefed on the activities of the task force, the governor has summoned an emergency stakeholders meeting tomorrow to discuss the present situation and thereafter take a decisive action to ensure that the information did not go beyond what it is now,” he added. He said that “we did not totally lock down the state because we did not make adequate provision for palliative measures, we allowed the people to look for what to eat and abide by the measures put in place by government, that does not mean we are weak, we are ready to do everything possible to safeguard the health of the people of Bauchi State.” Baba Tela then used the medium to confirm the new positive case discovered in the state on Sunday, assuring that the case has been isolated and is receiving treatment.
