The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has hinted that more Nigerians may benefit from the palliatives being distributed to mitigate the negative effects of the present restrictions imposed over the disease outbreak. Speaking at the daily media briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, chairman of the task force and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, said the process was being fine-tuned. He also confirmed that the PTF had a teleconference with President Muhammadu Buhari earlier in the day to give him an update on its activities. He said: “The PTF is fine-tuning the expansion of palliatives for the poor, vulnerable, aged and others as directed by the president and we shall reach you very soon. Similarly, the additional regulations and protocols will be released to the public. “Early today, the PTF held a teleconference with President Muhammadu Buhari to give him an update on the National Response. The interaction was robust and rich in guidance.” He reviewed the efforts of the task force to also update the citizens on the control of the outbreak especially the lockdown imposed on the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun states. Mustapha added: “Yesterday we addressed specific areas of the president’s broadcast which extended the lockdown of Lagos and Ogun states as well as the FCT. We also addressed the security concerns of citizens through the assurances given by the Inspector General of Police. “While we continue to pursue detection, testing, isolating, care and management of case as our strategy, we wish to appeal to all citizens to continue to obey the order to stay at home, maintain personal hygiene, avoid large gathering of people and report to health authorities whenever the symptoms are felt.”
