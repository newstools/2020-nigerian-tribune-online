As part of its contribution to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST), has made available 1400 post office locations to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid, medications and medical equipment to areas where they are needed and bridge the social distance gap necessitated by the pandemic. The General Manager, Corporate Communication at NIPOST, Franklin Alao, who made this known in a statement on Tuesday, expressed the readiness of the organisation to join hands with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) and other relevant agencies in the fight against the ravaging COVID-19.

To support the government’s stay–at–home directives/order and avoid non-essential journeys, NIPOST assures the public that we are going to make changes in our delivery processes like adopting longer retention period for parcels, to give customers longer time to collect or have their items re-delivered,” Alao said.
