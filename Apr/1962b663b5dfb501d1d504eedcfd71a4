Kaduna State government has warned travellers trying to breach its quarantine by entering the state to desist or face 14 days in an isolation facility. The notice was issued at the end of Wednesday’s meeting of the State Standing Committee on Covid-19. In a statement issued by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, the order comes into effect on Thursday, April 9. The state government said that all entry points would be barricaded and only authorised vehicles will be given passage. “Those denied entry will be asked to return to where they are coming from. Those who express a preference for entering Kaduna State will then be taken to spend 14 days in an isolation facility. “Persons without valid passes are strongly advised to cancel any plans to travel to Kaduna State. Security agencies have firm instructions to turn back people at entry points into the state like the Kaduna-Abuja road, Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road, Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road, Kachia Road, the Bwari-Jere-Kagarko road, Gumel-Kwoi-Keffi road, Zaria-Funtua road and the Jos-Manchock road. “This order also affects other entry and exit points into the state that may not be listed here. “The state has imposed clear quarantine regulations in the interest of public safety. These will be strictly enforced to keep people safe from Covid-19,” the statement said.
