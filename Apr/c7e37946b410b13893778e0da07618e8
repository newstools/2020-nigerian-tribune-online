The governor further disclosed that while the state awaits the delivery of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine, his administration is engaging the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO) to get necessary accreditation to establish a molecular laboratory in the state that could serve as a test centre for as many viruses as possible. He also said that the decision to close schools and social centres in the State was to promote social distancing which has so far been proven as an antidote to the spread of the virus. While answering questions on the youths recently apprehended by the State Rapid Response team of the State Taskforce on the restriction of interstate movement for coming into the State from Lagos, Inuwa Yahaya said that the arrest of the youths for quarantining was the proper procedure to check the possible spread of the COVID-19, especially given the fact that the youths were coming from Lagos which is the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The governor thanked traditional and religious leaders for their efforts in enlightening their subjects on the COVID-19 pandemic, assuring the people that the state is ready for any eventuality. The Chairman of the State Taskforce on COVID-19, Professor Idris Mohammed described the facilities provided as state of the art and some of the best one can find for the management of COVID-19 cases. The facilities unveiled by the governor included a 150- bed capacity isolation centre at Kwadon Infectious Diseases Hospital, for the management of mild to moderate cases, a fully equipped 50- bed capacity facility at the Federal Teaching Hospital and a 12- bed capacity Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) fully equipped for the management of severe cases, including mechanical ventilators, oxygen concentrations, cardiac respiratory monitors and other needed facilities as contained in a statement by Ismaila Uba Misilli, Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to the governor.
