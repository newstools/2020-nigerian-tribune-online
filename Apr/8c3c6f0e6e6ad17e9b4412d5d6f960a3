Epidemiologists, U.S. intelligence sources and residents have said they suspect Chinese authorities substantially undercounted coronavirus infections and deaths. Chinese officials have repeatedly defended the accuracy of their data. The adjustment in the Wuhan figure pushed the death toll in China to 4,632. Wuhan officials said they arrived at the new figure by double-checking data from medical facilities, crematoriums and testing records dating back to late March, and by revisiting records from prisons and nursing homes. Authorities also increased the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan by 325 to 50,333 after the review, the notice said.
