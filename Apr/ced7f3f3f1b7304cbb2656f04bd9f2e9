The Ogun State branches of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (Abeokuta, Ilaro, Ota and Mowe) have donated a sum of N1,000,000 to support the Ogun State government in its efforts at combating the spread of the COVID-19 in the state. While presenting the cheque on behalf of the society in Ogun State, the Abeokuta branch chairman, Engineer (Dr) Olanrewaju Apampa, commended the state government for its efforts in setting up functional isolation centres across the state; for the continuous public advocacy and sensitisation and for the steps being taken to mitigate the effect of the containment efforts on the citizenry. He also promised the willingness of the society to give technical assistance to the establishment and maintenance of the isolation centres, including assessment of any broken-down mechanical ventilator for possible repairs. “We are also in the process of developing a mechanical hand washing device, which we shall be promoting for use in schools and other places as soon as we get over the critical phase of this pandemic,” Apampa said.
