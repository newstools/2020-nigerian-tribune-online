Osun State government on Saturday said contrary to the report that six persons who tested positive to coronavirus disease have escaped from its Ejigbo isolation centre, only one of them actually escaped from the facility. The government denied issuing a statement that six persons in the isolation centre located at the General Hospital, Ejigbo have escaped. This was contained in a statement signed by the state Commissioner for Information and Civic Engagement, Mrs Funke Egbemode.] The statement reads: “Nothing can be further from the truth. As a government, we have not issued any statement to confirm or deny such story. Besides, a quick check showed that the name and number of the first person on the list of the purported missing patients is indeed currently in our facility in Ejigbo.” “Recall that  about a week ago,  we received 127 returnees from Ivory Coast and we have kept them since then to avoid community transfer of the virus. This morning, we embarked on a headcount and found out that only one person could not be accounted for by officials stationed at the Isolation centre out of the 127 persons.” “The state government is currently investigating the matter and will ensure that the missing person is brought back to the Isolation centre and we will also ensure we trace all his contacts.” “We want to reiterate that any official(s) found culpable will also be dealt with accordingly. We implore members of the public to discountenance the alarm being raised. We will continue to do everything to protect the lives of our citizens in this fight against coronavirus.”
