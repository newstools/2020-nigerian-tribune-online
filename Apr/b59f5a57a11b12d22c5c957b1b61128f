As part of measures to stop further spread of COVID-19 in Oyo State, the state government has made it mandatory for all residents to appear in public wearing face mask. Governor Seyi Makinde, who handed down this order, on Friday evening, said the state government would initially produce one million face masks for residents of the state. According to Makinde, 100 tailors, to be trained by experts, will be engaged to each make 10,000 face masks. He also announced the resolve of the state to increase isolation centres with focus on the state hospitals in Ogbomoso, Saki and Igboora. Meanwhile, the reopening of state secretariat has been shifted by one more week, with Monday April 27 set as new resumption date for civil servants. He maintained that even the new date was subject to further extension depending on the COVID-19 situation in the state. On palliatives, Makinde said distribution was yet to start because the data met on ground will make palliatives to fall into the wrong hands. He, however, said the state had now developed its own data that will ensure that only the poorest of the poor get the palliatives.
