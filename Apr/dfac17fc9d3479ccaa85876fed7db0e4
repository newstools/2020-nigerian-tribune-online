President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the latest ethnic violence in Taraba which left about 25 persons dead. According to a presidency statement made available to State House correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday night, Buhari said he was disturbed by the incident. Tribune Online reports that the statement quoted him as saying: “I am deeply disturbed by the resort to violence over disagreements that could be resolved through dialogue.” He added that “these frequent incidents of ethnic and communal violence is a failure of community leadership and the refusal to embrace dialogue as a means of conflict resolution.” He explained that “disagreements over lands or fishing ponds shouldn’t be allowed to degenerate into violence and destruction of life and prosperity.” The President said that “violence has never settled any problem and, on the contrary, it makes a bad situation worse and lay the seeds of future conflicts.” ALSO READ: Nigerians who have more than N5,000 account balance won’t get palliatives, says FG “If everyone says they must get what they want through violence, then we make it impossible to allow peace to prevail, thereby jeopardizing every prospects of amicable resolution of disagreements,” the President pointed out.
