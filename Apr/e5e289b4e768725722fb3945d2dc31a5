The Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in Nigeria has called for the release of Nigerians arrested in Thailand over offences committed but currently in Nigeria Correctional Centres, saying this is line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s approval to set up prerogative of mercy committees to recommend pardon or clemency in line with constitutional provisions. The director of mobilisation, Mr Musa Mukhtar, in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja said the move became necessary following fears that the COVID-19 pandemic might spread to overcrowded correctional facilities across the country, endangering the health of the inmates, and of the populace in general. These Nigerians were arrested in the Kingdom of Thailand over various offences and later transferred to Nigeria following a treaty between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Kingdom of Thailand in the transfer of offenders and co-operation in the operation of penal sentences which came into force on January 11, 2002.

Tribune Online recalls that the Attorney-General asked judges to consider the conditional or unconditional release of those who had spent six years or more in custody, as well as those who had no confirmed criminal cases against them. Others eligible for the pardon include those with terminal illnesses, low-risk offenders, and those with no sufficient legal basis to remain in custody. Also to be considered are convicts of minor offences with or without the option of fines and those who have fewer than three years left to serve after serving substantial parts of their jail term for offences that attract five years and above.
