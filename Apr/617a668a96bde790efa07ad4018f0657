As part of steps to ensure total compliance with its lockdown directive made to contain the spread of COVID-19, Osun State government has mounted barricades at all boundaries leading into the state and on major roads. This development came against the backdrop of the announcement that the 14-day lockdown in the state was not a curfew, but a total lockdown with no human and vehicular movements. The State Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs Funke Egbemode, who made this disclosure during an interview with newsmen on Tuesday, said the barricades were erected to restrict unauthorised movements across the state, adding that the government was intensifying efforts to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in the state and avoid a resurgence of the disease. Egbemode said: “The government is determined to protect Osun and its citizens. Hence, this move by the government is to keep defiant people from hurting themselves and endangering others. “The barricades will only be opened to essential duty vehicles, conveying materials needed for the fight against COVID-19. Non-essential travels and movements remain banned in Osun until further notice,” she added.
