IDENTIFYING problems without proffering solutions will amount to a wasted exercise. Every mental health disorder is treatable. Couples facing such a challenge should know that help is available to them. So, there is no reason to lose hope, and resign to fate. Once they embrace this truth, they will be able to seek for the available help. Research has shown that “victims” (patients) are reluctant to seek for professional help by going for diagnosis. According to Dr. Lasebikan, in his book, Women’s Mental Health Problems, “Only two in every five people experiencing a mood, anxiety or substance use disorder, seeks assistance in the year of the onset of the disorder.” You should also visit natural environment for green exercise. Nature impacts greatly on one, and helps one to unwind. Parks, games village, tourists sites revealing nature’s wonders are quite helpful in improvement of mental health. Regularly exercising will impact positively on the stress level, enhance a happy mood and self esteem, and stimulates the body for good night sleep. Conclusively, couples should know that help is available for any mental health disorders situation especially if help is sought early enough. People do recover from them, and nothing is strange about them, so we don’t have to feel shy to seek for professional help. As stated, it is a common phenomenon that is ignored or handled with neglect by many and that to their destruction. Many marital cases of physical abuse and spousal death could have been averted if only adequate attention is paid to the role of mental health in marriage.
