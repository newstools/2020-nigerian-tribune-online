In support of the efforts of the Federal Government to curtail the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Nigeria’s oil and gas logistics giant, INTELS Nigeria Limited, has donated two facilities to the Port Health Services (PHS) of the Federal Ministry of Health to serve as isolation centres at the Onne Port, Rivers State. INTELS General Manager, Legal and Corporate Services, Amaopusenibo Mike Epelle, while handing over one of the centres recently, said the isolation centres, located at both the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) and the Federal Lighter Terminal (FLT), Onne Port, were donated by the company to quarantine sick persons and any suspected case discovered by the Port Health Services on visiting vessels.

We commend the federal and Rivers State governments’ efforts aimed at protecting the public health. These isolation centres are part of our own support to complement the efforts of the government to stop the spread of the disease,” Epelle said. He said the second isolation centre, located at the FOT, would be ready soon. Epelle also said that INTELS is following strict work place safety measures outlined by relevant authorities including the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and Port Health Services in ensuring the safety of its workers in its areas of operations in Onne, Warri, Calabar and Lagos. He said, “INTELS is committed to the well-being of its staff. Health and safety of all the workers and visitors to our facilities remain a major priority in our management policy. Accordingly and in line with best global practices, we have initiated the creation of policies, guidelines and procedures targeted at preventing the spread of the coronavirus disease in our facilities.” The South South Zonal Coordinator of Port Health Services, Mrs. Ibitein Benebo, who received the keys to the isolation centres, thanked INTELS for the donation and assured of judicious use of the facilities.
