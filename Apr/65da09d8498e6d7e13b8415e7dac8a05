The Ekiti State government has disclosed that 70 out of the 73 people that had contact with the 29-year-old woman found to be infected with coronavirus have been isolated. Speaking in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, on Monday, the Health Commissioner, Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, said about 73 people that had contacts with the patient had been identified through aggressive contact tracing that was done by government. “Out of the 73, we have traced 70 of them and they are currently being monitored. We have advised them to be in self isolation for 14 days while the secondary contacts are being traced with the aid of our district surveillance officers. “Some of the suspects who didn’t have homes to perform the self isolation were being provided with accommodations by government,” the commissioner said. The commissioner added that 42 blood samples had been taken to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and that 39 had been done with no confirmed result as of now. Similarly, the Special Adviser on Security, Ebenezer Ogundana, said in view of the identified gaps, government had beefed up security at borders and virtually all porous portions had been closed down to check influx of the people. Ogundana added that the traditional rulers and youths of the border towns are being involved to check authorised and unauthorised movements into the state from neighbouring states.
