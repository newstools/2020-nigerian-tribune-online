In line with his resolve to explore home-grown solutions towards the prevention and cure of coronavirus, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has said he will be donating his blood as sample for research. Being a COVID-19 survivor, Makinde said the donation of his blood would help experts who are currently evaluating post-infection protection against coronavirus. Makinde made this decision known, on Wednesday, on his verified social media handles. “We have been advocating local solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic in Oyo State. “So, as a COVID-19 survivor, I volunteered to donate my blood to be studied by our experts researching on the ‘Evaluation of Post Infection Protection Against SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) in Nigeria,'” Makinde said. After his recovery from COVID-19, Makinde had expressed conviction in capacity and intellect of Nigerians evolve local solutions to the virus, adding that the state will support such efforts.
