Lagos State government said, on Monday, that the Ramadan edition of the emergency neighbourhood food markets for residents, essentially to address the problem associated with the lockdown and the promotion of social distancing in the fight against the spread of the dreaded COVID-19 in the state comes up on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal, disclosed this, explaining that the neighbourhood food markets would hold in 27selected public schools within 14 local government areas of the state. The commissioner pointed out that the neighbourhood food markets were basically set up in order to provide Lagosians access to food supplies during the lockdown with a view to preventing panic buying in line with the state governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s directives closing all markets and stores trading in non-essential commodities. He added that the makeshift markets within the neighbourhood are platforms for families that do not have the capacity to buy foodstuffs in bulk to have access to a market during the current lockdown in the state. Lawal explained that the markets would enable shoppers to buy produce and other everyday needs such as beverages, vegetables, fish, poultry products, bread and other essential needs at competitive, affordable and farm gate prices.
