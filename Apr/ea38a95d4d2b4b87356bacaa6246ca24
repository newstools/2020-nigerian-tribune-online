Residents of Odighi, a town in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State are presently living in fear following the alleged beheading of two people by suspected herdsmen on their way from the farm. The residents of the agrarian community expressed sadness over the incessant attacks on members of the community in their farms. The deceased were simply identified as Ben Itodere, 62, an Urhobo indigene and an Ebira man whose name was simply given as Nasiru, 45. A member of the community who did not want his name in print said the two hunters were killed on Wednesday in the farm by suspected herdsmen who allegedly beheaded them and covered their bodies with leaves. The incident triggered protest by youths in the community who took over the Benin-Akure highway to register their displeasure over the incessant killings in the community by suspected herdsmen. When contacted, the Edo State Police Commissioner, Mr. Lawal Jimeta, said he was yet to be briefed as he was at a security meeting at the time of filing this report.
