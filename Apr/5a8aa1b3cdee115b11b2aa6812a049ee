Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has revealed that the second case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state has tested negative twice and has been discharged. Recall that the 42-year-old patient, an indigene of the state, tested positive on April 1st following his frequent trips to and from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, which the government said could account for his infection. Fayemi, who made the disclosure through his official twitter handle @kfayemi on Friday, commended the state medical team at the Infectious Disease Isolation centre for their sacrifices and treatment of the patient. According to him, the task of containing the virus is yet to be over, urging residents to continue to adhere to the precautionary measures in a bid to stop the spread of the deadly COVID-19 in the state. “ Our second COVID-19 patient tested negative the second time and was discharged from our Infectious Disease Hospital today. While thanking our team for a job well done, the job is not finished.” The state is now free from any case of coronavirus with the discharge of the second patient.
