I need help for my 35 -year old sister who has been having breast discharge for the past four months. She is not pregnant, neither is she breastfeeding. Kindly help me. Her husband is getting worried. Judith (by SMS)  In view of the long history of the discharge, the ideal thing will be for your sister to see a doctor who will take her proper medical history, examine her breast and send a sample of the breast discharge as well as some blood to the laboratory for examination. Some of the questions the doctor will ask your sister is whether or not she is on any form of contraceptives or any medications. The breast examination will also rule out the presence of any breast lump. Apart from testing the breast discharge and checking the blood, the doctor may also ask your sister to go for a breast scan. All these examinations and tests are to rule out any form of blood or breast disease that may be responsible for your sister’s problem.
