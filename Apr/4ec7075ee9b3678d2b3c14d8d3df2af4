FOLLOWING the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and outcry by clearing agents that terminal operators are refusing to comply with demurrage and storage waivers as directed by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the NPA in a second letter to the terminal operators, have defined the terms of reference as regards which port charges should be waived. In a memo signed by the NPA’s General Manager, Ugo Madubuike on behalf of the NPA Managing Director, the agency stated that it will be granting terminal operators Credit Notes which commensurate with the rental relief the operators give to consignees. According to the memo dated April 8th, 2020 and addressed to all terminal operators, the NPA stated that, “Further to our letter dated 2nd of April, 2020, directing the suspension of rent charges on consignments for an initial period of 21 days and effective from 23rd March, 2020, kindly be informed that in-order to relieve you of the effects of the loss of rental charges due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Authority will grant Credit Notes commensurate to the rental reliefs granted by you to consignees within the period in reference. “Kindly note that the compensation will be guided by the following terms: the compensation will only cover cargoes situated in your terminal within the period under reference; the terminal must produce evidence of delivery records indicating waiver of rent for the period in reference; the compensation shall only cover storable cargo within respective terminals; and the compensation shall only cover charges approved by the Authority and published by the terminal.
