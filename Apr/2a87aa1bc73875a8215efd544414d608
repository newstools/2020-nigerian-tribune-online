The long wait of residents of Oyo State for palliatives may soon be over as state Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Jacob Ojemuyiwa, on Wednesday, said it had identified 90 per cent of the “poorest of the poor” to receive palliatives. Ojemuyiwa stated this on Wednesday while receiving donations from individuals and organisations for the state to distribute as COVID-19 palliatives. Noting that the state was not oblivious of the fact that the COVID-19 had imposed more hardship on its residents, Ojemuyiwa said the government had sent people to the various local government areas and local council development areas and the needed data was being turned in. Though he noted that the state still needed more donations, he assured the donors that the palliatives will get to the right poorest of the poor. “Our people are hungry and the pandemic has compounded their hunger. Everyday, I receive hundreds of messages of people requesting for support.
