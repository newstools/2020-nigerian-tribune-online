The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu on Wednesday raised the alarm over continued night journeys embarked on by the organised transporters despite the restriction orders of the Federal Government to curb the further spread of the deadly COVID-19. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), Frank Mba, the Police boss declared that the ugly trend has proven to be counter-productive as it undermines the tireless efforts of the Federal Government to curtail the further spread of the pendemic in the country. According to the IGP: “This warning is sequel to intelligence at the disposal of the Force showing that road transport workers, especially interstate operators, have continued to defy the lockdown order and cessation of movements as emplaced by the Federal Government as they continue to embark on night journeys. “Consequently, the IGP has directed Commissioners of Police to ensure full implementation of the restriction order, especially as it relates to night travel without being unmindful of categories of exempted persons and the fundamental human rights of Nigerians.” ALSO READ: Nigerians who have more than N5,000 account balance won’t get palliatives, says FG The IGP who restating that the lockdown was for 24 hours daily and that night hours were not excluded, called on the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) and the Public Transport Owners of Nigeria Association amongst others, to warn their members to strictly adhere to the restriction order of the Federal Government. He warned that violators would be made to face the full wrath of the law. The Police boss, however, commended the understanding and cooperation of Nigerians in this critical period and assured that the Force would continue to do its best to protect the lives and property of Nigerians. The IGP equally enjoined Nigerians to take advantage of emergency numbers of the Force in reaching out to relevant police authority at the various command levels.
