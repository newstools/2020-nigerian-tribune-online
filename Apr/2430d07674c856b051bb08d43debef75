The Africa Union of Economic, Social and Cultural Council, (AU-ECOSOCC) has reacted to suggestions by French Scientists that vaccines being produced for COVID-19 should be first tested on Africans. The scientists were said to have made the suggestions considering the low mortality COVID-19 death rate recorded in Africa compared to other countries in the world. This was conveyed in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja by the Council’s Nigerian Representative, Mr Oba Olasunkanmi John. He described the statement as yet another proof of neo-colonization, noting that Africa has served in the past as laboratories for European and American experiments. “But to think that such level of racism can still be displayed in the 21st century and at a time like this when the whole world is grieving shows the level of contempt with which Africans are held and how derogatorily Africans in Diaspora are being treated,” he said.

It is not out of place to point out that the mortality rate among the G20 member countries is much higher than the entire Africa countries put together,” it further read. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
