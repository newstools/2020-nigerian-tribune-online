Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, on Monday announced that the state government will establish a Task Force to man its borders to ensure that people of the state are protected from coronavirus. Signing the Executive Order RVSG-02 No. 3 -2020 at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Monday, Governor Wike said the Task Force would be in place because of the likelihood of sabotage from federal security agencies. He said: “This is the third Executive Order that I will be signing since the coronavirus pandemic started. This third Executive Order is very important. “We suspect there will be sabotage on the part of the security agencies. That is why we are appointing a Task Force to man our borders. We owe our people a duty to protect them. There is likely to be sabotage. Our Task Force will be at the borders to protect our people.” Wike said that contrary to the report on the release of Exxon Mobil Staff, it was Strictly on the intervention of respected Nigerians and not due to the threat to embark on strike. “No federal agency spoke to us. But there were respected Nigerians who intervened and they were released by 8.00 a.m. on Sunday. “Exxon Mobil signed and agreed that they will take back their staff to Eket. That was the condition we gave for their release,” he said. He announced that the laws on restriction of movement must be implemented for the safety of everyone. “On Sunday, we arrested some staff of BOA who violated the law. They have been arraigned in court and remanded,” he said. He reiterated that coronavirus is no respecter of persons, pointing out that it has killed both influential and the underprivileged, hence the need to be more vigilant.
