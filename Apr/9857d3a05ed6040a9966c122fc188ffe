Kano State governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has relieved the Commissioner of Works and Infrastructure, Engr Mu’azu Magaji, of his appointment with immediate effect following his unguarded utterances against the person of late Abba Kyari. It would be recalled that the sacked commissioner, on Saturday, on his Social Media page, said he sympathised with the Federal government, his family over the death of Abba Kyari, He, however, stated that “we pray this time around, may God gives us a good CoS.”  Comrade Garba said as a public servant, the commissioner ought to have respected the profanity of the office by refraining from any act capable of rendering the office to disrepute. His words: “The action of a public servant, personal or otherwise reflects back on the government and therefore, the Ganduje administration would not tolerate people in official capacities  engaging in a personal vendetta or otherwise.” According to the statement, late Abba Kyari had led a life worthy of emulation by serving his country to the best of his ability.
