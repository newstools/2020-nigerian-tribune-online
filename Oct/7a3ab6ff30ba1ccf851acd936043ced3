The panel had  among other things, investigated allegations of human rights violations and abuse of office against the affected personnel  and recommended reform or restructuring of the outfit. Presenting the report to the PSC Chairman, Alhaji Musiliu Smith, in Abuja on Friday, the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Tony Ojukwu, called for a speedy implementation of the panel recommendations. A statement by the PSC spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said Ojukwu observed that the PSC chairman had all it takes to deal appropriately with the report of the panel. The statement was  titled, ‘PSC to partner Human Rights Commission, promises immediate action on report of presidential panel on reform of SARS., According to Ojukwu, “We have come to see a PSC determined to play a leading role in the reform of the Nigeria Police Force”. Ojukwu said that the reform was the most topical issue in the country today, adding that a lot was expected from the PSC. He noted that the panel called for and received 113 complaints on alleged human rights violations from across the country and 22 memoranda on suggestions on how to reform and restructure SARS and the Nigeria Police Force in general. Ojukwu stated that at the end of the public hearing, the panel recommended 37 police officers for dismissal and 24 were recommended for prosecution. According to him, “the panel also directed the Inspector -General of Police to unravel the identity of 22 officers involved in the violation of the human rights of innocent citizens.” While receiving a copy of the report, Smith assured that the Commission would collaborate and support the NHRC in the promotion of good governance. He, however, said that for effective reform of “the much-maligned SARS,” there must be a deliberate effort to select capable, professional and credible people to replace the disbanded outfit. The selected officers, he added, must be properly trained and exposed to regular training. According to him, “there must also be close supervision of the newly selected officers so that the nation will not experience the rot that became the fate of the disbanded unit.” Any misconduct, he noted, should be severely and promptly handled. The former IG said that the government should show more concern on the funding of its vital agencies as they needed robust funding to do their job. He also made a case for proper and good accommodation for police officers, stressing that “these officers need good accommodation to put in their best.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
