Men of the Lagos State Fire Service are currently battling to put out the raging inferno ravaging the headquarters of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) in Marina, Lagos. Recall that angry mob had earlier on Wednesday set the NPA headquarters on fire as part of the #endsars protest currently rocking many parts of the nation. Speaking to the Tribune Online exclusively, a staff of the agency who wouldn’t want his name in print as he is not authorised to speak said due to the inability of the agency fire service department to put out the fire, men of the Lagos State Fire Service have been called in to put the situation under control.

The fire started in the morning and our fire service department could not put it out. Angry mob from the Lagos island area who had earlier ransacked the palace of the Oba of Lagos came to the NPA headquarters and set the agency on fire from the rear side of the building. “They gained entrance into the agency headquarters from our back entrance, not the Marina road entrance. Before our fire department peoole were aware, the fire had spread. “But the Lagos State Fire Service officials are here and the fire is being put under control,” the NPA staff told the Nigerian Tribune exclusively. Efforts to confirm the situation of the fire with the NPA Spokesman, Adams Jatto proved abortive as repeated calls made to his mobile phone were not responded to as at the time of filing in this report.
