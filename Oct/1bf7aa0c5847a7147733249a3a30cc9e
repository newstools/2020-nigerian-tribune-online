I have been battling with pimples for the last one year. I have used all types of medications with no change. Now, at age 20, my face is full of dark spots which have almost disfigured my face. Kindly come to my rescue. Adaora (by SMS)  Pimples are usually common at your age because of the effect of hormones and the oily nature of your skin. In addition to the common anti-pimples medications in the market, you need to keep your skin clean and dry.
