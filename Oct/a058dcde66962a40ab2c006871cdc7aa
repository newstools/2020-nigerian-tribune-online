The Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on the COVID-19 pandemic, during the last briefing, said in order to ramp up testing, there will be full implementation of national testing week. The chairman said: “Although Nigeria is no longer in the top five countries by cumulative deaths in Africa, the PTF continues to urge Nigerians to change their attitude of scepticism and nonchalance to the virus. “The PTF is fully conscious, but not deceived, by the fact that our recovery rate is high and very encouraging. We still urge, however, that everyone should get tested because testing is the only way to detect, isolate, trace and treat.” Fewer deaths, recoveries Tribune Online analysis showed that the COVID-19 death rate reduced last week. Also last week, two persons died from COVID-19 complications, according to the data provided by the NCDC.
