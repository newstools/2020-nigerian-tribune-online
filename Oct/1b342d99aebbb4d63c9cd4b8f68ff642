My six- year -old daughter has been complaining of sore throat for the past few days. The doctor who saw him said he doesn’t need antibiotics while his father thinks he needs. Kindly let me know what to do as my daughter is in severe pain. Betty (by SMS)  Sore throats are common in children and can be painful. However, a sore throat that is caused by a virus does not need antibiotics. In those cases, no specific medicine is required, and your child should get better in seven to ten days. In other cases, a sore throat could be caused by an infection from some bacteria. Such cases will definitely need antibiotics. To know the difference, a throat swab should be taken and sent to the Laboratory for analysis.
