This ended the three-year trend of positive, but modest, real GDP growth recorded since the second quarter of 2017. “GDP growth is projected to be negative in the third quarter of this year. As such, our economy may lapse into the second recession in four years, with significant adverse consequences. “However, we are working assiduously to ensure rapid recovery in 2021. We remain committed to implementing programmes to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty over the next 10 years.” The N18.5 million proposed spending on domestic cooking gas is part of the total N132.1 million planned spending on fuel and lubricants where motor vehicle fueling will gulp N45.6 million and another N67.9 million will go to motor vehicle fuel cost.
