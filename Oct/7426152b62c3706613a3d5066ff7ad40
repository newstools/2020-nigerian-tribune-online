Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, on Tuesday night, met with all heads of security agencies in the state following the continued #EndSARS protest in spite of the 24-hour curfew imposed on Monday. Speaking shortly after the security council meeting held in Government House, Benin, Obaseki said the meeting became necessary to analyse and access the security development in the state in the last 24 hours. “Following the unfortunate development from the #EndSARS protest over the last few days, we just concluded a security council meeting. We deliberated extensively on the security issues, fortunately, the DIG, Celestine Okoye has come to support the command in maintaining law and other in the state”, the governor disclosed. While thanking the citizens of the state for remaining calm and complying with the curfew order, Obaseki noted with regrets that a few hoodlums violated the curfew most of Tuesday, adding that due to that, “the security chiefs have met and certain stern action would follow shortly”.
