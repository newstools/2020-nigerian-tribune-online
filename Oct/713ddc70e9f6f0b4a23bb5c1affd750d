President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday morning said it makes no sense for petrol to be cheaper in Nigeria than Saudi Arabia and some countries in Africa. Addressing Nigerians in his Independence Anniversary speech, the president listed how much some countries in Africa and even Saudi Arabia pay for petrol, saying those countries pay higher for petrol. According to him: “Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point; Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre; Niger, also an oil producing country sells one litre at N346. “In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre. Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.” Full text of the president’s speech: I speak to you today as your President and fellow citizen on this epoch occasion of our country’s 60th independence Anniversary. As President, I wish to renew my appreciation to Nigerians for entrusting me with your hopes and aspirations for a better and greater Nigeria. Long Live the Federal Republic of Nigeria. God Bless us all. Thank you.
