The #EndSARS protests took a violent turn in Lagos on Monday as one person was killed and four others were wounded as angry protesters clashed with policemen. The Monday protest paralysed economic activities in major parts of Ikeja, Lekki, Surulere, Magodo and the Lagos-Ibadan expressway as vehicular movements were halted by the protesters. The protests took place a day after the Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed Adamu had ordered the disbandment of the police unit, Special Anti Robbery Squad. The protesters in Lagos defied the presence of the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the state commissioner of police, Hakeem Odumosu chanting anti-Buhari songs.
