The immense contribution of this unit of the Nigeria Police who work tirelessly to counter the criminals is on record for everyone to see”, Governor Matawalle further added. He wondered why every good thing happening to the country must have attackers who ultimately cannot escape our charge of working against the majority interest. “Doubtlessly, those who are vehemently against the operation of SARS in the country have more questions to answer from Nigerians,”Governor Matawalle posited. He called on the Federal Government and the Inspector General of Police not to succumb to pressure but to ensure that the right thing is maintained for the future security and prosperity of all Nigerians.
