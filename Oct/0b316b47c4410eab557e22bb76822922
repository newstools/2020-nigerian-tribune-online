The governor, while speaking to the victim’s wife, Mrs Ngozi Iloamuazor, disclosed that he came along with his Attorney General, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), to ensure that the family gets justice. Sanwo-Olu told the Attorney General to take over the case immediately to ensure justice was done, vowing that the case would not be swept under the carpet.
