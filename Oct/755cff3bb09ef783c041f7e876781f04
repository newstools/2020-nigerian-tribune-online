The chairman, Boss Mustapha, said: “The PTF is glad that the economy is opening-up the more, but warns that as we continue to study developments in Europe and other parts of the world, no nation can be said to be immune to a possible second-wave if the guidelines and protocols are not adhered to strictly. Nigerians need to anticipate this and prepare. Our hope and prayers are that it shall never happen.” ALSO READ: COVID-19: Nigeria discharged 1,096 last week, lowest figure in one month Last week’s cases On Sunday, 163 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the country, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 60,266.
