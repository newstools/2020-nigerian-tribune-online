Talented American rapper and singer, Tanya Maraj-Petty, known widely with the stage name ‘Nicki Minaj’ is one of the latest moms in town, as the rap-goddess welcomes a new child with her husband Kenneth Petty. Billboard reported that she welcomed her first child with her husband Kenneth Petty on Wednesday, September 30, in Los Angeles, United States of America. The duo would also be celebrating their first wedding anniversary on October 21. The Baby’s name and sex was not revealed. Recall that the 37-year-old rap queen announced her pregnancy with a series of baby bump pictures on her Instagram page on July 20 this year. Her husband, Kenneth who registered as a sex offender in Califonia, in a court document obtained by TMZ last July, was, however, granted the chance to modify his pre-trial release conditions, which allowed the 42-year-old to not only travel with his wife but also be present with her for the birth of their baby if it occurred outside of his curfew.
