I am a guy of 19. During my years of puberty and maturity, I did not experience any enlargement in my penis. Although I have semen. My penis is as small as a kid’s own. This is not hereditary although my mother used to tell me that it has always been small. I used some enlargement drugs but these didn’t work. I am getting worried in case I am abnormal and would not be able to procreate. Please help me. Bright (by SMS)  As previously explained in this column, the ability to have sex or procreate does not depend on the size of one’s penis. This issue of abnormality does not come in since people have different natural endowments. Just as we have ladies with different sizes of breasts, so we also have men with different sizes of penis. I will therefore advise you to stop looking for a solution to what is not a problem. No, your penis will not grow with time. My advice is for you to stop worrying about your size and rather concentrate on forming good relationship with members of the opposite sex and with time you will discover that you are a real man.
