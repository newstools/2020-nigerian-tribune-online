The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Oyo State coordinator, Mrs Grace Ogbuogebe, has described the set of outgoing corps members as one of the most patriotic the scheme has ever witnessed. She made this statement during the passing out parade of the 2019 Batch C, Stream 1, corps members on Thursday, October 15, at Mapo Hall, Ibadan, Oyo State. According to the state coordinator, the outgoing corps members were able to make a difference when COVID-19 struck by constructing an automated hand washing machine as well as making and donating face masks, liquid washing soaps and hand sanitisers to the public. “They have shown that truly, they are patriotic and they can be trusted and dependent any time and in any situation as they have shown when they rose up to the challenges COVID-19 created,” she said. Ogbuogebe who congratulated the 5,752 outgoing Oyo NYSC corps members urged them to utilise all they have been taught during the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme, noting that it would create a means of livelihood for them as well as enable them to become job creators.

Speaking to Tribune Online, Sumisola Adeniji, an outgoing corps member, noted that the scheme has helped her acquire a lot. “NYSC is not a scam like some people say, from the three-week orientation in camp to my Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) to SAED, I can say I learnt a lot. “I will advise intending corps members and currently serving corps members not to waste their one year service but utilise the opportunity and give their best towards the development of our country,” she added.
