The Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum (PDPGF) has observed that the deduction of 0.5% out of the total revenue accruing to the Federation Account for the benefit of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund is unconstitutional. It has, therefore, urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to take steps to repeal Section 4(1) of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (Establishment) Act, 2019 which purportedly authorizes the Federal government to make the deduction. The governors made the declaration in a communique issued at the end of a Zoom Meeting of the forum and signed by their Chairman and Governors of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal. The communique was made available to the media in Abuja on Wednesday. The governors also showed concern over the Water Resources Bill, 2020, calling for its stepping down its consideration in the House of Representatives to allows for more consultations and public engagement. The Forum disclosed that on its part, it has referred the Water Resource Bill to the bodies of Attorney Generals of PDP State governments for advice.

We advise that the constitutional provision be upheld. “Furthermore, the Forum canvassed for appropriate consultations with the Governors of various States on the deployment of Police Commissioners to the States since the Police is a common institution that executes the laws of both the Federal and State governments. “The Forum implored Mr President and the National Assembly to repeal Section 4(1) of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (Establishment) Act, 2019 which purports to authorise the President to deduct 0.5% of the total revenue accruing to the Federation Account for the benefit of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, as it is patently unconstitutional. “The beneficiaries of the Federation Account are the Federal, States and Local Governments ONLY. More creative funding options should be explored. “The Forum noted the controversy surrounding the Water Resources Bill, 2020 and noted the stepping down of the Bill in the House of Representatives. It urged for further consultations and public engagement in the processing of the Bill. “The Forum referred the Bill to the bodies of Attorney Generals of PDP State governments for advice. “Finally, the Forum congratulated Nigeria @ 60 and enjoined the government and the people of Nigeria to redouble efforts on national unity, national cohesion, economic, social and political integration and progress in the years ahead.” In attendance at the meeting were Governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia State), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom State), Senator Bala Muhammad (Bauchi State); Douye Diri (Bayelsa State); Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta State); Dave Umahi (Ebonyi State); Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu State); Nyesom Wike (Rivers State); Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde (Oyo State) and Bello Muhammad Matawalle (Zamfara State).
