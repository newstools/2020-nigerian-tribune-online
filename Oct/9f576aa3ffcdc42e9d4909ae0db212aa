COVID-19 cases dropping The Presidential Task Force on the COVID-19 during last Tuesday’s briefing has affirmed that the number of confirmed cases in the country is dropping but wants Nigerians to be vigilant as the threat of the virus remains. The chairman, Boss Mustapha, said: “The numbers are dropping when we compare on a month-to-month basis but we still have to be vigilant. “Health is a shared responsibility on the concurrent list and as partners in the fight against COVID-19; we urge sub-national entities to thread on the side of caution by increasing the rate of testing.” Nigerians are urged to continue wearing facemasks, stay away from crowded places, avoid mass gatherings, maintain simple hygienic practices and follow all the COVID-19 prevention guidelines.
