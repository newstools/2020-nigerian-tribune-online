I developed cough, sore throat and fever after a recent weekend trip to the village. In view of the current COVID-19- pandemic, I am worried if what I have is the COVID-19 infection. Kindly advise me. Worried (by SMS)  While it is true that these symptoms could also occur in patients with the COVID-19 infection, they could also occur in someone with a chest infection.
