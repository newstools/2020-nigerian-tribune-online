According to the statement, “Yesterday I received with rude shock and maximum displeasure the killings of many citizens of Sabon Birni by bandits. “The bandits riding on motorbikes and estimated to be in their hundreds stormed the villages of Garki, Dan Aduwa, Kuzari, Katuma and Masawa, all about 3 kilometres from the town of Sabon Birrnin Gobir at about 6:00 pm on Wednesday.

These losses of lives and destruction of property are not yours alone but that of the entire people of the state.” He, therefore, on behalf of the government and the people of Sokoto State crave for the indulgence of the victims to remain patient and continue to cooperate with the government, while praying that by God’s grace, the state shall overcome these travails.
