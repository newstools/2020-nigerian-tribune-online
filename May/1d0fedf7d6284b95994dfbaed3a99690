Thailand on Saturday extended a ban on international passenger flights until the end of June, the country’s aviation regulator said, as new cases in the country dwindle. The Civil Aviation Authority’s ban extends a previous order that was set to run until the end of May. The announcement comes as the country begins to relax local restrictions after reporting single-digit increases of infections from the new coronavirus this month. On Sunday the government will allow malls and department stores to re-open. It will also shorten a nighttime curfew by one hour, to 2300 to 0400, from 2200 to 0400.
