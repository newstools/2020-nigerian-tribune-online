Despite speculation, the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) offered no hint of an intention to adjust timetable for the conduct of governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, the elections had been fixed for September 19 and October 10, 2020 in Edo and Ondo states, respectively. A memo addressed to staff of the Commission ahead of their resumption, “Guidelines for Resumption of COVID–19 Lockdown,” and made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja directed the immediate reopening of its offices in Ondo and Edo states, due to the upcoming gubernatorial elections. It, however, urged its senior officials in the affected states to consult with the relevant State Governments for issuance of necessary permits.
