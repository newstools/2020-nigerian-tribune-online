He said an investigation was ongoing to recover more cows including those recently rustled at Mbemum village. Speaking shortly after receiving the cows, Alhaji Ya’u Isa, State Chairman of Pulaku Njonde Jam, thanked the Police command and Adamawa government for their quick intervention and recovery of some of the stolen cows. Isa said that within one year, Fulani herders had lost no fewer than 450 cattle and 240 sheep to cattle rustlers in Numan and Lamurde LGAs. “We discussed the issue with the state deputy governor, Seth Crowther, on how to bring a lasting solution to the problem and restore peace in the affected areas.
