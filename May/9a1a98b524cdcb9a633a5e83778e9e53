China lashed out at President Donald Trump on Tuesday, claiming the US president is using ‘witchcraft’ to lead during the coronavirus pandemic after he admitted to taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent contracting the disease. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China Communist Party’s official publication, Global Times, blamed Trump for the high number of US deaths from coronavirus, claiming the White House would be ‘burned down’ by the public if it were China. “President Trump is leading the US’s struggle against pandemic with witchcraft, and as a result, more than 90,000 people have died,” Hu wrote on Tuesday in a now-deleted tweet. “If it were in China, the White House would have been burned down by angry people.” The editor of the governing publication is close with Chinese leadership. Hu’s comments came after Trump said on Monday that he takes antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Tuesday morning that the president shared his personal health information because he wants to be ‘transparent’ with Americans. “The president just wanted to be transparent about his personal health decision that he made in consultation with his doctor,” McEnany told Fox & Friends, adding that others should only take the malaria drug if they are prescribed it by their doctors. Trump’s revelation that he is taking the drug sparked immediate criticism, including from House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi who said the ‘morbidly obese’ president is putting his health at risk.
