President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, said the measure put in place to commence gradual relaxation of the lockdown, was what the congress and labour have been clamouring for. He pointed out that the idea of gradual opening up of the system was what they had been calling for. The NLC President said “This is what labour has canvassed for. Everything we have asked for is gradual opening up, that lockdown cannot be perpetual. “And also, lockdown cannot be abruptly opened up. Clearly speaking, it has met the observation of labour and some of the issues we have raised that we must find a balance between continous lockdown and continuing to meet the needs and livelihoods of many Nigerians. It is in tandem with what is happening globally.” He restated commitment of the union to continually interface with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to ensure the global pandemic is addressed. Also speaking on the decision of some employers of labour to cut down the salaries of their workers, especially in the aviation industry, he stated that, the situation like that was why the unions are there. Wabba said: “We will continue to respond to such challenges. Those are the challenges we will confront headlong. It is not something that is cheering but it is obviously challenging and if the means of livelihood of any family or worker is cut off, certainly, you know it will bring more challenges. “Certainly, labour will ensure those things dont happen, and where they happen, we should be able to put in place mitigation measures.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING Clarence Peters Invited For Questioning Over Dancer, Kodak’s Death
