The local government election held in Benue State, on Saturday, with low turn out of electorates in some polling units visited. Tribune Online, who monitored the election in Makurdi and Guma local government areas of the state, reports that some polling units have few electorates on line to exercise their civic right. Though, this is attributed to the social distancing rule directed by the State Independent Electoral Commission. The State Governor, Samuel Ortom, who casted his vote at Ako polling unit around 9: 18 am said that the turn out of electorates was in bits to forestall crowding of people at the polling units. Ortom, who expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the election, said the situation report across the state showed that the election was peaceful.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) did not show any commitment to the election. “They did not pay the required fees. They went to court demanding that the election should be put off but they lost the case. “The Court ruled that the election must hold. It would have been conducted before now as earlier scheduled but due to COVID-19 it was shifted to today,” the governor concluded. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
