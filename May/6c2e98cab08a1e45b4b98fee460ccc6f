THE ongoing face off between Nigeria and Canada over the repatriation of 319 Nigerians stranded in the North American country since the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic has continued to generate criticisms across the country’s aviation sector. The latest reaction came from Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ART), a non-governmental body of aviation professionals which faulted the latest frustration of Nigeria’s domestic carrier, Air Peace to evacuate the stranded Nigerians back home by the Canadian government. ART in a statement issued said: “ART registered its displeasure at the botched Air Peace Airline evacuation flight for stranded Nigerians in Canada due to the prevalent global lockdown caused by the covid-19 pandemic. “We reject in totality the nebulous safety concerns conveyed by the government of Canada. ART views this action not only as an unfriendly act but an unwarranted discriminatory and anti- competition acts bordering on avoidable aero politics. “The demand of our common humanity at these challenging times posed by the ravaging covid-19 requires the maximum cooperation of all. We therefore, request our government, especially the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Aviation to stand firm against this discriminatory and unfriendly act. Air Peace remains Nigeria’s flagship duly authorised by Nigeria for the evacuation mission of her distressed citizens in Canada. “In the diplomatic spirit of respect and cooperation among nations, the ART requests that Nigeria should persuade Canada to review her position and bring succour to the stranded Nigerians in her domain.”    YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING Pantami Used Armed Officers To Evict Our Staff, Abike Dabiri Alleges
