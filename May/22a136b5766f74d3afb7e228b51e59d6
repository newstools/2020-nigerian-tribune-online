Hussaini said the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has opened three functional molecular laboratories. He said that the Dangote Foundation and ’54gene’ donated a mobile laboratory at the Muhammadu Buhari Hospital, Giginyu. ”The laboratories have a 650 test capacity per day while plans are underway to increase the capacity to between 1, 300 and 1, 500 per day. The coordinator added that the state government had trained health workers on Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC), to protect them against contracting the COVID-19. “Some of the infection recorded among health workers is linked to lack of knowledge on how to protect themselves against infections. “We have quickly turned around the tide and the health workers in isolation discharged,” he said. On the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19, Hussaini said that most of the cases were recorded in the Kano metropolis while 31 LGAs recorded at least one case of the virus. The coordinator added that state government in collaboration with development partners had scaled up the campaign to create awareness on the COVID-19 pandemic. NAN reports that the Kano State Ministry of Health confirmed 923 COVID-19 cases and 751 active cases. The ministry said 134 were discharged and the state recorded 38 deaths, as at May 26.
