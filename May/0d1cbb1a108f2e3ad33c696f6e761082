THE International Labour Organisation ((ILO) has called for a  strengthened  and comprehensive social protection systems to lessen the impact of crises such as COVID-19. It also stressed the need to plug social protection gaps in developing countries to prevent future crises. The organisation said COVID-19 crisis has exposed devastating gaps in social protection coverage in developing countries. According to a new analysis from the ILO, recovery will only be sustained and future crises prevented if they can transform their ad hoc crisis response measures into comprehensive social protection systems. Two briefing papers released by the ILO warned that the current gaps in social protection could compromise recovery plans, expose millions to poverty, and affect global readiness to cope with similar crises in future. The brief on social protection responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries, describes social protection as, “an indispensable mechanism for delivering support to individuals during the crisis.” The brief on social protection responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries warned policymakers to avoid a singular focus on COVID-19 because this could reduce the availability of health systems to respond to other conditions that kill people every day.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING COVID-19: Buhari May Announce New Policy Monday
