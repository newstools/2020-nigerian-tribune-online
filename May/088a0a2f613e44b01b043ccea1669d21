The stage now appears set for the showdown between Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu, a former Secretary to Edo State Government over the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) following his adoption as the consensus candidate of the faction of the party believed to be loyal to the national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Ize-Iyamu, who was the governorship candidate of the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2016 election in Edo State emerged on Tuesday night in Abuja through consensus candidate. He is expected to slug it out with Governor Godwin Obaseki for the direct primary of the party slated for June 22. He was presented by chairman of the screening committee, Senator Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) after six of the seven members of the committee voted for him.
