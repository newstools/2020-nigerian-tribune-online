Professor Ibrahim Gambari will be announced as the new Chief of Staff (CoS) to President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, confirmed to Tribune Online that an announcement will be made, but stopped short of saying that the former Minister of External Affairs has been picked. “Announcement during FEC tomorrow,” the presidential spokesman said in response to a text message. Reports were rife in the social media that the Kwara State-born diplomat has been appointed to replace Mallam Abba Kyari who died of COVID-19 complications on April 17. President Buhari will preside over a virtual meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday, the first since the lockdown of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun states over the coronavirus pandemic. Gambari is expected to be unveiled as the new CoS during the meeting. The new appointee served as the nation’s Foreign Affairs Minister during the Buhari military administration.
