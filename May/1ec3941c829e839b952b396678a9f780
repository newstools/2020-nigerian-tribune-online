Former Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Professor Temitope Alonge, on Monday, revealed the various drugs and others used to treat coronavirus patients in Oyo State. Professor Alonge, who is also the Coordinator of the state isolation centres, disclosed this at the Government House, Ibadan, during the press briefing by the state governor, Mr Seyi Makinde. Alonge said patients at the Infectious Diseases Centre, Olodo, Ibadan, were treated with doses of Azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, Vitamin C, Zinc and good food. “At the treatment centre at Olodo, on admission, the patients who are predominantly adults have a three-day course of Azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine twice a day, we then complement this with Vitamin C and supplement Zinc twice a day. “This is in addition to the excellent nutrition that they get all the time and now, some of them complained that they had put on weight while they were at isolation centre. “Also, the viral load will have to go down for cycle threshold value. The moment CT value goes up, it means viral load is down and when the viral load is down, we can predict those who can become negative. We also had to stratify the disease based on viral load or CT value to differentiate who stays where. “And it has helped us to prevent reinfection or exposing those who have high viral load to those who have low viral load,” Alonge said. According to Alonge, the treatment protocol is responsible for continued discharge of patients with 25 persons discharged so far.
