Ningi said the canoe capsized due to overload, lack of maintenance and a hole that allowed water to weigh it down. He said the canoe had more than 21 people on board, noting that there were too many people and goods on the canoe. The Ward Head of Gwaskwam, Alhaji Abdullahi Maikano, also told NAN on the phone that there were over 20 passengers on the wooden canoe that capsized. “Five were rescued while out of the others, only five dead bodies had been discovered so far,” he said.
