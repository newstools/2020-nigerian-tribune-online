The committee’s Chairman and Deputy Governor, Umar Kadafur, confirmed this in a statement on Sunday evening. He said of the 12 discharged coronavirus patients, six were discharged by UMTH isolation centre, while the remaining six are from the state’s isolation centre at Bulabulin Ngaranam. Additional 22 coronavirus patients are currently awaiting the results of their final test and are expected to be discharged on Monday or Tuesday.
