Former Oyo State Governor, Rashidi Ladoja has chided his erstwhile deputy, Chief Adebayo Alao Akala for being economical with the truth in alleging that he was worse than a spare tyre and not allowed to function. Alao-Akala, in an interview, had insinuated that Ladoja did not allow him to perform his constitutional duties while they were both Governor and Deputy between 2003 and 2007. Ladoja through his media aide, Mr Lanre Latinwo, described Alao Akala’s claims as figment of his imagination, utterly untrue mischievous and misleading. In the statement, Ladoja pointed out that Alao Akala was assigned the responsibilities of local government affairs and monitoring of parastatals in the state. ‘’The claims that Alao-Akala was not allowed to perform while in Office as Deputy to Senator Ladoja, is a figment of his imagination because as a one-time Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the former governor is adequately equipped with the law.
