Speaking, one of the contractors who identified himself as Comrade Lucky said contractors were awarded various agriculture contracts by the ministry since 2018, and had completed the contracts, but the Ministry had refused to pay them. “We are here to take our destiny in our own hands, because since 2018 we were given the contracts we bidded for, which we also executed. We have been coming here  for payment with the certificate of completion issued to us by the same  Ministry. “The ministry based on whatever consideration have done selective payments leaving some of us out. We have met with both the Minister and the Permanent Secretary, and nothing has been done. At a point, the Permanent Secretary promised to pay us, but later refused to pay. “I have also heard that some of the Ministry officials have been demanding for  percent from some of our colleagues,  but as for me, nobody has asked me”, he said.
