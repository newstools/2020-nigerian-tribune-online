Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the Federal Government over denials and cover-up on the whereabouts and activities of the Chinese medical team who came into the country in April. The party which said such was a betrayal of the public trust by its citizens on the government, the Federal Government to apologise to Nigerians. Tribune Online reports that the party accused the Federal Government taking Nigerians for granted over the manner it is handling the controversy surrounding the Chinese medical team. The PDP in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the conduct of the Federal Government in disclaiming the Chinese team and declaring that it cannot account for their whereabouts after it had accorded them state reception, further exposed the dishonesty, lack of transparency and inherent corruption that pervade the APC administration. The PDP in the statement described as bizarre that the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, disclaimed the Chinese team, denied involvement and knowledge of their whereabouts whereas clarifications by the Chinese Embassy and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) indicate that the team had been in CCECC facility and had also collaborated with our health agencies. The statement reads: “PDP noted that the APC administration would have faced the anger of Nigerians for its lack of transparency, at the lapsing of the 48-hours ultimatum, but for the clarifications by the Chinese Embassy and CCECC.
