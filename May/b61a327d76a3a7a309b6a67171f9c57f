Council of Imams and Ulama, Kaduna State chapter has called for a gradual relaxation of the lockdown enforced in the state as part of measures put in place to contain the further spread of COVID-19 in the state. This is even as the council commended the state government for the prompt action taken in preventing the spread of the virus across the state. Tribune Online reports that the chairman of the council, Shaykh Ibrahim Nakaka, made the appeal in a statement he issued to newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday. The statement reads: “The Council appreciates the good leadership qualities exhibited by the Governor Mallam Nasiru Ahmad el- Rufai, his Deputy, Dr Hadiza Balarabe who acted in his absence and the entire state task force committee on COVID-19 in ensuring that the coronavirus does not cause much havoc to the people of Kaduna State compared to its neighbouring states where their state governments failed to act immediately right from the onset of the pandemic.
