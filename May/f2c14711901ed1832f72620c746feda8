Vera, 22 was reportedly killed on Wednesday, May, 27 by the Rapists who savagely hit her head with the canister of a big fire extinguisher at one of the Pentecostal churches in uptown Benin-Aybor road where she had gone to read following reports of the impending resumption of academic activities at the institution. Friends and well-wishers who have since taken to Facebook and other social media to mourn the promising young girl all agreed, going by their different posts, that she was intelligent, focused, serious with her studies and never got in anybody’s way.
