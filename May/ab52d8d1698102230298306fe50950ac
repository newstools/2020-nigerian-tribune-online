Speaking with journalists during an inspection visit to the Sobi Specialist Hospital’s Isolation Centre in Ilorin on Friday, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq said that 11 of the index cases at the isolation centre are travellers from Lagos and north-west states who were intercepted by security operatives deployed to enforce the ban on interstate travels. He expressed delight that community transmission of COVID-19 has not set in Kwara State.
