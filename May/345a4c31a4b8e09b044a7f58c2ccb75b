The Lagos State Government has appealed to the Federal Government to assist the state in mitigating the effects of erosion and protect Lagos coastline. The Commissioner for Waterfront, Mr Kabiru Abdullahi, made the appeal, on Wednesday, at the year 2020 Ministerial Press Briefing, to commemorate Gov Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s first year in office. ”The erosion of Lagos coastline is a direct impact of the construction of the Eastern and Western Moles by the Federal Government as far back as 1912 to provide safe access for vessels coming into the state harbour. ”This has put a heavy financial burden on the state with regards to the protection of its coastline,” Abdullahi said. He urged the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) to create channels for boat navigation on the waterways and stop enabling illegal dredging activities. According to him, the agency needs to support Lagos in preventing the degradation of its shoreline, road infrastructure and halting environmental pollution. ”NIWA should refocus its attention on its primary mandate, which is to create channels for boat navigation on the waterways, instead of acting as land speculators, among others,” he said. Abdullahi added that 34 dredgers operating illegally were arrested and prosecuted by the State Taskforce on Environment and Special Offences during the period under review.
