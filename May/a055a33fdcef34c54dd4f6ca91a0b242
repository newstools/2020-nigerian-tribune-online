He, however, said that in spite of the suspension of operations, the airline was busy attending to other social responsibility services for its communities. “During this time, we are supporting local communities to cushion the effect of the lockdown. “This is our little contribution to the government’s efforts at ameliorating the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable in our midst. “We are also conducting necessary overhaul and preservation on our equipment,’’ he added. Ola said further that notwithstanding the restriction on flights, the organisation’s call centre would continue to be available to take calls and enquiries from clients and customers. He advised Nigerians not to endanger their lives during the pandemic by staying safe all the time. “Please stay safe and ensure strict compliance with all health advisory by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control,’’ he advised.
