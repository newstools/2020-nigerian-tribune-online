Staff of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State have called on the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu to intervene in the crisis in the institution, over the non-payment of their salaries for six months by the management of the institution. The workers accused the management of administrative and financial recklessness which led to the non-payment of their salaries. The staff of the institution alleged that despite the inability of the management to pay the six months salaries, they have secretly commenced recruitment process through the backdoor. One of the workers who pleaded anonymity said the management of the school was insensitive to the plight of the staff, adding that all the pleas to pay their salaries fell on deaf ears. He said, “The governor really needs to set up a panel to look into what is going on in this institution. We are being owed salaries for six months, yet the management is secretly recruiting workers. “Where will they get the money to pay the new staff. It is a serious matter and the government should do something, we are suffering.” Another staffer said, “The polytechnic has gone back to the era of 2015/2016 when the polytechnic could no longer paid salaries of its workers. Fractional payments of the salaries became the order of the day then. We are returning to that era and it is very unfortunate.” But while reacting, the Public Relations Officer of the institution, Mr Samuel Ojo, who confirmed the development, said the matter would be resolved soon. He said, “Their claim is no longer news, the government is not saying it is not owing and the Akeredolu administration has done so much for this school. The government is aware of our financial predicament and they would do something.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING MONDAY LINES: Almajirai’s Expedition To The South
