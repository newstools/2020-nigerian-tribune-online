The incident happened between 1 pm and 1:30 pm at the popular Lagos Street/Oba Market Street junction in downtown Benin. Residents fled the area for fear of reprisal attack by soldiers who later stormed the area. Tribune Online reports that the incident occurred barely 24 hours after the state government shut down all business activities in Lagos street over the refusal of traders and residents to comply with the state government’s directives to participate in the ongoing screening and testing exercise for coronavirus (COVID-19). The testing was part of the measures put in place by the government to contain the spread of the virus in the state. Tribune Online reports that the soldier was in the company of his wife when the incident happened Saturday afternoon.
