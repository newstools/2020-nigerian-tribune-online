TWO Muslim organisations, the National Council of Muslim Youth Organisations (NACOMYO) and the Muslim Media Watch Group of Nigeria (MMWG) have commended President Muhammadu Buhari on the choice of Professor Ibrahim Gambari to replace the late Malam Abba Kyari as his Chief of Staff. The groups described the appointment as fitting for the former minister, academic and diplomat. In a statement signed by the National President and National Secretary General, Malam Sani Maigoro and Alhaj Mas’ud Akintola, NACOMYO expressed the belief that Professor Gambari is a worthy addition to the Buhari administration. The organisation urged the new Chief of Staff to meet the expectations of the citizens which it said are very high. In the same vein, the MMWG commended President Buhari for choosing Professor Gambari as his new Chief of Staff, saying “the choice is ideal and most appropriate.” The group said Professor Gambari’s international diplomatic experience would add value to governance in Nigeria. In a congratulatory message to the new Chief of Staff on Thursday by its national coordinator, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, the MMWG expressed the hope that the appointment would rekindle the hope of all Nigerians in the administration of President Buhari. Meanwhile, NACOMYO expressed sadness over the death, during the week, in Kano, of its second national president, Dr Sadis Mohammed Sadis. It described the deceased as a humanist who used his scholarship to promote Islam. The organisation prayed for the repose of his soul and fortitude for his family to bear the loss.
