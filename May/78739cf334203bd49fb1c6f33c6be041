The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has enjoined Nigerians to imbibe the virtues of the Ramadan season in all aspects of their life especially in national leadership. The party, which also felicitated with Nigerians, particularly the Muslim community, on this year’s Eid-el-Fitr celebrations, as the Ramadan fast comes to a close today urged Nigeriana at all levels, not to lose sight of the essence of the Eid-el-Fitr and the eternal lessons of Ramadan, but bring them to bear by living in truth, selflessness, tolerance, forbearance, honesty and transparency in all their dealings. The National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said: “The party notes that the fervent prayers and the successful completion of the Ramadan fast point to the determination by the people in their ardent trust in God to overcome the vicissitudes of life both as individuals and as a nation, particularly as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic.
