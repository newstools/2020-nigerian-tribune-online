A health management organisation, AXA Mansard Health Limited has introduced its telemedicine service as part of its commitment to improving access to quality healthcare service by Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In a statement issued to newsmen in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer, AXA Mansard Health Limited, Mr Tope Adeniyi stated that the health sector may become overwhelmed with the growing spread of COVID-19, leaving patients with other health issues at risk of neglect.
