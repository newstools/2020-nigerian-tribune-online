As the world marks the 2020 Earth Day amidst efforts to halt the spread of rampaging Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) Limited, has lauded the doggedness of environment frontline workers, including street sweepers and garbage collectors, for helping to keep the country clean. The company, in a statement, commemorating this year’s Earth Day, tagged ‘Climate Action’, and  signed by its Director, Public Affairs and Communications, Ekuma Eze, urged Nigerians to embrace the highest standards of personal hygiene and clean environment, to curtail the spread of the virus and protect planet earth. “These are trying times not only in Nigeria but across the globe, and the importance of personal hygiene cannot be over-stressed. Indeed, we commend the public health workers: street sweepers, garbage collectors and those keeping our environment friendly for us all to live,” he said. Eze noted that while lockdowns introduced by  countries to reduce the spread of COVID-19 had seen pollution levels reduced, and  had brought about a more robust and thriving wildlife , now,  he however asked Nigerians to shun activities that could further cause damage to the  environment. “But we don’t have to wait for lockdowns to do the right things concerning the earth and the environment. We should promote sustainable environmental practices to preserve the environment for posterity. The earth, as rightly noted by scholars, is not an endless deposit of resources to exploit,” he added.\  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING Lagos Will Not Hesitate To Review Easing Of Lockdown If… ― Sanwo-Olu
