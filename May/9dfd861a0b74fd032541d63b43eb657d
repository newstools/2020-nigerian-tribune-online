The husband of a 30-year-old woman who planned with her lover to murder him at Akim-Pameng in the Atiwa West District of the Eastern Region of Ghana has said that despite what she did, he wants his wife back home. According to him, his wife, Mavis Brepor, popularly called Maadwoa, is a respected married woman who deserves another chance despite the circumstance surrounding the whole issue, Ghanaweb reported. Speaking on a radio programme in Ghana on Wednesday, the 55-year-old man revealed he met Maadwoa at the age of 16 although she had already given birth. Mr. David Gator said: “After 14 years of dating and having three children, we got married last year, 23rd February 2019. She has never offended me since we got married so I want you to help me and I will be grateful to have her back home,” he stated. A few weeks ago, the Manhyia Divisional Police Command in the Ashanti Region arrested Maadwoa and her lover for conniving to kill Mr. Gator at Pamen near Kwabeng. The two were arrested after they mistook the would-be contract killer’s cell phone number for Manhyia Divisional Police Commander’s. The Manhyia Divisional Police Commander, ACP Kwaku Buah, revealed that the lover, Patrick Asare, while dialing the phone number of the would-be contract killer, mistakenly mixed up some of the digits and called him. The Asokwa District Court in Kumasi has however remanded the two lovers in police custody.
