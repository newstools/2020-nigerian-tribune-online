The House of Representatives on Tuesday unveiled plans to conduct a forensic investigation into the recent recruitment of graduate trainees by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) with a view to determining how many persons were recruited from the various host communities. Tribune Online reports that the resolution was passed following the adoption of a motion on the urgent need to investigate the termination of the employment of over 300 casual staff of Warri Refining and Petro-Chemical Company (WRPC), sponsored by Hon. Thomas Eveyitomi. In his lead debate, Hon. Eveyitomi who called for the House intervention observed that the workers were disengaged while coronavirus pandemic was ravaging Nigeria and the world at large. According to him, “management of Warri Refining and Petro-Chemical Company have gone ahead to sack over 300 casual staffs of the Refinery, in spite of the Federal Government directives that no government agency or private establishment should sack or lay off any of its staff. “The House is aware that all the affected persons are indigenes of the host communities where the refinery is located, which is made up of Itsekiri and Urhobo communities. “Sometime in July 2019, Hon. Ben Bakpa presented a petition to this House on behalf of the host communities seeking, amongst other things, de-casualisation of the employment status of indigenous workers with Warri Refining and Petro-chemical Company.

To this end, the House directed Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and the management of Warri Refining and Petro-Chemical Company to reinstate the over 300 persons affected by this action pending the investigation by the House Committee on Public Petitions.
