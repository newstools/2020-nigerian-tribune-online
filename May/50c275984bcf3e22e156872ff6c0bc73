A pregnant woman, Mrs Waidat Adedeji, died on Thursday, at Ita-Otu General Hospital, Ibiade in Ogun Waterside Local Government Area of Ogun State during labour. Tribune Online learnt that the woman who fell into labour and was being taken to the hospital on a motorcycle by the rider along with one of her children. The motorcyclist was said to have been stopped by policemen enforcing lockdown order at Sowore checkpoint for questioning on why those failed to obey the social distancing order and refusal to wear face masks. It was gathered that the policemen delayed the motorcyclists for hours before they were later released. The woman, according to a source, died some minutes after. Angered by this development, youths in the area took the remains of the woman to the Abigi Divisional Police Headquarters, blaming the police for being responsible for her death. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to Tribune Online. Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said the policemen were on official duties enforcing the lockdown directive when a motorcycle with three people was stopped by the policemen. “Our officers were not responsible for the pregnant woman’s death. There were three occupants on a motorcycle as against the directive of the state government that only two people should occupy a motorcycle at a time. “They were stopped and interrogated on why they did not obey the sit at home order. They informed the police that the woman was being conveyed to hospital for delivery, and having noticed that the woman was in pains, our men allowed them to proceed,” he added. Tribune Online learnt that prompt intervention of community leaders saved the situation from degenerating further.
