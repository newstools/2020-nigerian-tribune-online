President Muhammadu Buhari has signed the Executive Order 008 on Voluntary Offshore Assets Regularization Scheme (VOARS) 0ctober 2018. Tribune Online reports that the endorsement of the Executive Order 008 by President Buhari followed input by stakeholders input and need to strengthen implementation mechanisms and structures. “Consequently, the Amendment to Executive Order 2008 was signed on 20th May, 2020 by President Buhari”, Dr Umar Gwandu, the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) stated in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Thursday. Executive Order 008 as amended mandated the Attorney General of the Federation to set up and implement a Voluntary Offshore Assets Regularisation Scheme (hereinafter referred to as “VOARS”). VOARS, the statement said, gives all relevant persons and their intermediaries who have defaulted in the declaration of their offshore assets the opportunity to voluntarily declare and regularise their offshore assets, subject to fulfilment of the terms and conditions stipulated in the Order and other subsequent regulations. In order to ensure seamless exchange of information, VOARS will work closely with the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) which has worldwide access to relevant financial information.
