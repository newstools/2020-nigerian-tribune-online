AS Muslims all over the world celebrate this year’s Eid al-Fitr, they have been advised to view the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic as a common enemy which the entire human race must continue to fight in unison until it is defeated. The Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Alhaji Dawud Akinola, who gave the admonition in an Eid al-Fitr message to the Ummah, likened the pandemic to a world war without the use of conventional weapons. In the message made available to newsmen by his media aide, Akin Abolade, the Muslim leader stated that the pandemic caught the world unawares thereby exposing the helplessness of mankind, as shown by the inadequacy of the healthcare system of even the developed world in the face of the scourge. Aare Akinola, who noted that only a few people alive could have witnessed such a devastating pandemic before, said the situation should serve as a wake-up call for people to submit to the supremacy of Allah and trust in His power to heal the world of all afflictions. He, however, said that for the battle to be totally won, everyone must be ready to play their part. He commended the federal and state governments for effectively deploying human and material resources in the prosecution of the war against coronavirus, noting that the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 was doing an incredible work to fight the scourge. He called on Muslims and indeed all citizens to continue to obey government directives meant to ensure their protection against the virus, including observation of social distance, regular washing of hands, use of sanitiser and wearing of face masks. Meanwhile, Alhaji Akinola appealed to Muslims to celebrate the festival modestly within their households “in keeping with the demands of our current reality.”    YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING WHO Considers Madagascar’s COVID Organics For Clinical Observation
