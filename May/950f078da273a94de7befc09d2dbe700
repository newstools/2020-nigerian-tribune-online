9MOBILE and telemedicine provider, Mobihealth, recently announced that they had partnered with the Association of Resident Doctors of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) and Northfield Health Services to curb COVID-19 in Kano State. The Chairman of 9mobile, His Royal Highness Alhaji Nasir Bayero, made this known in a statement last week. Bayero said that the partnership was part of the concerted efforts aimed at protecting healthcare workers and citizens by providing access to telemedicine consultation. He said this would curb the further spread of the coronavirus disease in Kano State. He noted that the service would enable doctors to diagnose, conduct investigations, treat and remotely monitor patients for general medical problems. Bayero said the service would also help to decide the order of treatment for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related illnesses. “Citizens and residents of Kano would have access to highly-trained and experienced medical doctors for primary care consultation via web, app, voice or video call. “This would be done from the comfort of their homes simply by downloading Mobihealth Consult app or dialling the toll-free lines for consultation. “Mobihealth’s telemedicine service marks a new beginning for the people of Kano because it provides them access to doctors in Nigeria and diaspora. “We encourage residents to download “Mobihealth Consult app” from their device app store or by registering on app.mobihealthinternational.com to enjoy the service,” Bayero said.
