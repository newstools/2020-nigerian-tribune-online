DESPITE paying the sum of  $461.89million (about 13.4 per cent ) of the  $3.313billion debt (Chinese loans) owed the Peoples Republic of China, the outstanding (Chinese loans) against Nigeria is still $3.12billion (about 94 per cent), a document from the Debt Management Office has revealed. The document accessed on DMO’s website gives the breakdown of the payment as $192.21million (Chinese loans) being part of the principal, while $269.68million has been paid as interest. The issue of the nation’s indebtedness to the Asian country has been a cause of concern to many Nigerians as a House of  Representatives’ investigation revealed the existence of a Sovereignty Guaranty clause in some of the agreements.  The clause empowers China to take over the assets constructed with the loans in case of default by Nigeria. According to the DMO document, the Chinese loans which are tied to a number of projects such as rail, road, communication, power and agriculture, each has a tenor of 20 years, attracts 2.5 per cent interest and a moratorium of seven years. According to DMO, as of March 2020, the agreement for the oldest of the Chinese loans was signed on December 20, 2010,  while the newest was signed on May 29, 2018. Repayment for the current loans will continue until 2038.

Nigeria and China signed a loan deal of $325.67million on April 26, 2016, to enable Nigeria to fund its 40 Parboiled Rice  Processing Plants Project. No part of the money has been released.

An agreement for a loan deal of $1.267billion was signed between Nigeria and China on August 18, 2017, to enable  Nigeria to finance its Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section). $759.84million, representing 59.96 per cent of the total, has been released.

The loan deals for the Supply of Rolling Stocks and Depot Equipment for Abuja Light Rail as well the Greater Abuja Water Supply, $157million and  $381.09million respectively, have been signed, but China has not disbursed any part of the loan. Many Nigerians have expressed concern that with the inclusion of the Sovereignty Guaranty clause in the agreements,  Nigeria might lose some of these projects to China in the event of failing to meet the repayment terms but Mr Rotimi  Amaechi,  Transport Minister, has assured Nigerians that there would not be any need for the Chinese authorities to seize the nation’s assets as the country would pay back its debts to China. While speaking on a television programme at the weekend, Amaechi said, “It’s not that Nigeria doesn’t have the capacity to pay back. We’ll payback. At 2.8 per cent, what other countries would give you that loan? 2.8 per cent for 20 years with seven years moratorium, why can’t your payback? The repayment plan is not done by us, it’s done by the Ministry of finance, but they are meeting the requirements.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buhari Disowns Mamman Daura On Zoning Presidency President Muhammadu Buhari has distanced himself from the remarks attributed to his nephew, Mamman Daura, in which he opposed the application of rotational presidency in the… Read Full Story $500m China Loan: Controversial Clause Signed During Jonathan’s Administration ― Amaechi The Minister of Transportation, Hon Rotimi Amaechi has disclosed that Nigeria has already paid back $96 million out of the $500 million loans the country borrowed from China for the construction… Read Full Story Can Buhari Separate Two Chickens In A Fight?
