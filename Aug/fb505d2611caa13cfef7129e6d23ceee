Lagos State government has enjoined civil servants in the State Public Service to step up the dedication to duty and service to the state, assuring that the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration would deploy feasible strategies to achieve its campaign promises to Lagosians. The Chief of Staff (CoS) to Lagos State Governor, Mr Tayo Ayinde, gave this charge while speaking at the sent forth ceremony organised for retired members of staff of his office. The retirees are; Mrs Kehinde Oyedemi, Mr Samsideen Makinde and Mr Mutiu Dada. Ayinde, while rejoicing with the officers for attaining retirement age and unmeritorious service offered the state, noted that retirement from active service was a necessary phenomenon once an officer had put in 35 years in service or attained the age of 60 years and, therefore, the dream of every officer to retire gracefully and honourably with an unblemished record. “It is the dream of every officer to retire gracefully and honourably with an unblemished record,” he said, even as wished them well in retirement.
