Amid the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across Africa, the centre disclosed on Thursday that some 23 African countries are currently implementing entry and exit restrictions, requiring COVID-19 testing and test certificates. Amid the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the continent, the Africa CDC has called for strong continental and global collaboration to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Africa. The Centre Director, John Nkengasong, called for the strengthening of national public health institutions, the development of competency-based workforce and expansion of community-based health programmes to fight COVID-19. He, in particular, mentioned China’s “barefoot doctor” programme as an exemplary initiative African countries can emulate to help them comprehensively fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
