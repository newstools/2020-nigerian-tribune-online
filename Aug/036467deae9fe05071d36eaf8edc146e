An Edo High Court in Benin has restrained the Police, the Department of State Security (DSS) and other security agencies from arresting former Speaker Edo House of Assembly, Kabiru Adjoto. The court’s order is coming on the heels of allegations by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state that the former speaker and others sponsored thugs who recently invaded the state assembly. Justice Efe Ikponmwonba on Tuesday granted the order, following an ex-parte application filed by RID Okezie Esq. asking the court to restrain the Police, DSS and NSCDC from arresting or detaining him without the process of law.
