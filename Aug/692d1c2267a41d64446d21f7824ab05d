Nollywood actress Kate Henshaw received countless accolades from social media users when she warned parents against exposing their children on the social media. The actress also talked about the dangers associated with putting their children out there on social media. The mother-of-one, who shared the controversial post on her verified Twitter handle on Thursday, tweeted: “I know it’s hard but resist the urge to put your children out there on social media.

May God protect our children in this new age.” This, however, drew a lot of comments from Twitter users as many lauded her for sharing such a post at a period like this, as they attested to have learnt from it. Some also vowed to delete their children’s pictures from social media immediately.
