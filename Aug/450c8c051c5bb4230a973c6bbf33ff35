The Zonal Head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Sani Abdullahi, has said that the fight against corruption in the country would not be successful without the input of media. It was for this reason he stated that when he assumed office, he decided to pay a visit to the Nigeria Union of Journalists Secretariat (NUJ) in Kaduna. According to Abdullahi, the visit was meant to further cement the existing relationship between the commission and the media. The media he said is important in ensuring the commission’s success. He appreciated the efforts of Kaduna journalists for covering their activities while urging that they continue to support the commission in their fight against corruption, saying, without the media support, we would not be where we are today.
