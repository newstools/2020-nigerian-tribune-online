The Speaker, who was in the company of the Chief Whip, Tukur Ibrahim, Ado Wakili (Burra Constituency), Clerk of the House, Umar Yusuf Gital and management staff of the House, sympathised with them over the unfortunate incident. He also condoled with them over the murder of their breadwinner and husband.

The speaker also urged them to intensify search and surveillance until the perpetrators of the heinous act were apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law.
