I rear and sell pigs for a living. I also love eating pork especially the non- fatty part. I am also aware that it has a lot of nutrient values. However, I have heard some people who complain about how bad it is to consume pork. Apart from religious reasons, is pork really as bad as it is being touted? Ilozabe (by SMS)  Although Pork is an excellent source of protein and provides several important vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B-6, Zinc, Pottasium among others, some religious groups and cultures most notably, Jews and Muslims do not eat it because they consider it “unclean”. Pigs are omnivores. Their internal systems are fairly similar to that of humans, and they eat a wide variety of foods. This means that pork is highly susceptible to pathogens. However, these pathogens can be killed by thorough cooking but can infect the consumer if not thoroughly cooked. All said and done, Pork still remains the most commonly consumed meat in the world.
