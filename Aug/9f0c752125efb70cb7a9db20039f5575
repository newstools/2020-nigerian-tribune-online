Nigerian-born model, Abuka Onuegbu Jonathan, popularly known as Bigg Joo has said that social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Model Kartei, Model Management are platforms that have contributed to the success of many models. Bigg Joo, in an interview with R, said while the lifestyle of a model is not the easiest one, he would not give it up. He said modelling involves constant travelling and being away from home, friends and familiar places most of the time, adding that having to wait endlessly for castings, clients, shooting can be exhausting, “but when you are passionate about it you don’t notice the hectic part of it.” According to him, life as a model helps one see the world differently as it helps one to learn from different cultures. “You learn the art of patience and to take what life brings to your table and accept what it doesn’t. You also meet thousands of people and that helps you learn how to ‘read’ people. That way, you build amazing friendships all over the world.” Speaking on those who inspired him, he mentioned top models and fashion gurus like Armando Cabral, Billy Huxley, Jeremiah Ogbodo, David Gandy and Bryan Okwara. “When I see how they started and how far they have gone in the industry, they inspire me a lot,” he said.
