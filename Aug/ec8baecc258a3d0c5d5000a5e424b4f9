The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed shock over the judgment of the Supreme Court affirming the election of Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the 2019 Kogi State governorship election. A statement issued by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary, in Abuja, on Monday, maintained that even though it accepts the verdict of the Supreme Court, as the apex court in the land, “the judgment fell short of the expectation of the majority of the people of Kogi State and Nigerians in general, who collectively looked up to the court to remedy the manifest injustices, manipulations, violence and killings that marred the election.” The party added: “Indeed, the judgment had not inspired hope in our national quest to ensure that our elections are violent-free as well as deter unpatriotic individuals who resort to violence and killing to gain access to power, as heavily witnessed in the Kogi election.
