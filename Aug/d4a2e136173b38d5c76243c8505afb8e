Less than 24 hours before the final submission of the names of candidates and their running mates for the governorship election in Ondo State, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has picked a serving member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ikengboju Gboluga as his running mate. The PDP has forwarded the name of the lawmaker representing Okitipupa/Irele Federal Constituency at the Lower House, Gboluga, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace the name earlier submitted by the candidate. Jegede had earlier picked one of the aides of UNILAG, Olumide Ogunje, from Irele local government area of the state as his running mate. It was gathered that Jegede on Monday submitted Gboluga’s name to the National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Sencondus, at the national secretariat in Abuja.
