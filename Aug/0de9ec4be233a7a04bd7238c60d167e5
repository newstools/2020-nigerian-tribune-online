He noted that the present administration was committed to supporting the reduction in the cost of RoW, to allow broadband penetration in the country. Tambuwal had pledged to engage the British High Commission and other development partners, to ensure that the state successfully achieved its digital agenda, #SokotoDigitalAgenda.
