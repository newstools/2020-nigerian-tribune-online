The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division on Tuesday dismissed the appeal brought before it by a former member of the House of Representatives, Farouk Lawan challenging the ruling of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, which rejected his no case submission. The trial court had, in a ruling, dismissed Lawan’s no case submission and ordered him to enter his defence in a case of $500,000 bribery allegation preferred against him by the Federal Government. Justice Olabisi Ige who delivered the judgment held that the prosecution has sufficiently linked the appellant (Farouk Lawan) to the alleged offences slated in the 3-count charge filed against him. Justice Ige consequently dismissed Farouk Lawan’s appeal for lacking in merit and affirmed the ruling of the trial court, which ordered the former lawmaker to open his defence in the matter. Lawan was being prosecuted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) for allegedly collecting 500,000 dollars part of a 3 million dollars bribe. The money was said to have been requested to facilitate the removal of Femi Otedola’s company from the list of firms indicted by the House of Representatives Ad hoc Committee on Fuel Subsidy in 2012, which the former House of Reps member was the chairman.
