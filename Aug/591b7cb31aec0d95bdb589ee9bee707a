According to a release from the Wale Oke Media Office on Wednesday, at the well-attended ceremony, the vice-chancellor said the institution decided to celebrate Bishop Oke because of his spiritual, educational and economic contributions to the development of humanity.

Speaking at the occasion, Bishop Oke said he felt honoured for the institution’s gesture in naming a building after him. “I am short of words with the honour done to me in naming a whole building after me in this prestigious university. I will ever be grateful and may God continue to uphold the institution, the management and staff as well as the students,” he said.
