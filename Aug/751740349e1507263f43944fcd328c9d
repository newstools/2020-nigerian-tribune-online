The pan Yoruba socio-cultural group has backed Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and his Oyo State counterpart to reject the decisions of the Federal Government to take control of Amotekun. Afenifere, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Yinka Odumakin, said Amotekun, a regional security outfit for the South West cannot function under the control of the Inspection General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. Odumakin said Amotekun, in line with laws that created it, can only function under the control of respective states which are not surbodinates to the Federal Government. He said: “The Federal Government in its power drunk blaze did an unpardonable gaffe two days ago that Amotekun regional security of the West will function under the control of IGP.

States are coordinates with FG and not subordinates at all. “Afenifere is very glad that the Chairman of South West Governors  Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu and Oyo State Governor  Engr Seyi Makinde have both rejected the unfederal suggestion. “We back them and insist on the rights of our homeland governments to control internal security. “Enough of what has not worked. “We advise the Federal Government to continue patching its failed spots of the security architecture and allow regions freer hands to run their initiatives,” Odumakin said.
