Erin wo; the elephant has fallen. On August 8, 2020, I received a phone call from one of my colleagues that Senator Buruji Kashamu had taken his final bow from mother earth and had returned to his Creator. I became numb and dumbfounded. To Allah we come and to Him is our return. As an Islamic scholar and a lawyer, what came straight to my mind was to pray for the late senator. Death is a constant reminder to everyone that we can’t live forever on this earth; it is our good deed that will continue to speak for us when we are no more. Now that Senator Kashamu is gone, those who benefited from his good deed will forever remain grateful to him even in death. To his enemies, his death is a source of great relief but it is certain that all of us will die one day. The question is this: who will replace Senator Kashamu in Ijebu Igbo? I wish to make it very clear that it will take a very long time before we could get a replacement for Senator Kashamu; he was loved by the people of Ijebu Igbo. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should present his younger brother to replace him at the National Assembly whenever it is ready to hold the rerun election like they did in Osun State when Senator Ishaq Adeleke died, they should repeat this system. The people of Ogun State and Nigeria in general, including all his colleagues particularly Senator Ben Murray- Bruce, will miss him. It is shocking to lose a caring and greatly loved bread winner. It is in view of this that I join the oba of Ijebu Igbo and Governor Dapo Abiodun to commiserate with the family members of Senator Kashamu and pray to Allah to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. He is gone but not forgotten. The Ogun State government should immortalise him. Jimoh Mumin Esq. Ibadan.
