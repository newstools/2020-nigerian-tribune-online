Ahead of school reopening for both public and private schools for exit classes only, South-East Governor’s forum chaired by Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, has insisted that random sampling of COVID-19 tests be conducted on the teachers and students. Professor Uchenna Ortuanya Director-General South-East Governors Forum made this known in a communique issued to newsmen at the end of the South-East governor’s virtual meeting. The communique reads, “The governors of South-East states have resolved to open both public and private schools for exit classes only (JSS3 and SS3) to enable them to prepare and take their WAEC exams. “The governors have started the decontamination of all the schools involved including providing hand sanitisers and running water in line with COVID-19 NCDC protocols. “Health workers shall be sent to the schools to train the teachers and students on COVID-19 NCDC protocols and to also enforce the same. “Governors do advise our dear teachers and our children to know that COVID-19 is real though not a death sentence but prevention is better than cure. “Please obey all NCDC protocols on COVID-19.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buhari Disowns Mamman Daura On Zoning Presidency President Muhammadu Buhari has distanced himself from the remarks attributed to his nephew, Mamman Daura, in which he opposed the application of rotational presidency in the… Read Full Story $500m China Loan: Controversial Clause Signed During Jonathan’s Administration ― Amaechi The Minister of Transportation, Hon Rotimi Amaechi has disclosed that Nigeria has already paid back $96 million out of the $500 million loans the country borrowed from China for the construction… Read Full Story Can Buhari Separate Two Chickens In A Fight?
