The interim national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) which has Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni as chairman has resolved the crisis in the Cross Rivers State chapter of the party. A new chairman, Mathew Mbu ( junior) emerged on Tuesday after a meeting with the caretaker committee at the party national secretariat in Abuja. The Cross Rivers State chapter of the APC has been polarised into factions with the duo of Honourable John Ochalla and Ntufam John Etim parading themselves as chairmen of the party in the south-south state. Addressing newsmen at the end of the meeting, national secretary of the caretaker committee, Senator Akpan Udoedehe, said the crisis has been resolved while the party leaders have shown a commitment to working as a team. He thanked President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Executive  Committee of the party for ensuring the success of the peace deal.

I am happy to announce to all of us that we have reached a consensus and we have finally achieved the peace in Cross River State. “May I use this opportunity to thank Mr President and the NEC for giving us the opportunity to bring peace to the party.” Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jeddy Agba, spoke in the same vein as he declared that the new chairman,  Mathew Mbu was a product of consensus. ” I am glad to announce that today we have seen an end to the crisis in Cross River. We have sat down and we have agreed and come to a unanimous conclusion that we have a new party chairman in the person of Senator Matthew Mbu (Jr) to henceforth lead us in Cross River APC.” Senator Udoedehe was however evasive on the leader of the party in the Cross Rivers State chapter as he said, ” The national chairman is the leader of the party in the states. ” The new chairman, Mbu, promised to run an inclusive administration, create a sense of belonging among all the party chieftains and work towards the party victory in the forthcoming senatorial elections in Criss Cross Rivers North and subsequent elections. “This has come from God. We are a family and we will surely move and work as one. Families do have disagreements. Families sometimes quarrel but families also reconcile and when they reconcile and walk as one, nothing can stop them. We are going to go back to Cross River State and work together. We all need each other and we will truly work together as a family and come to all future elections, APC will win in Cross River State.” The displaced factional chairmen equally promised to cooperate with Mathew Mbu for the success of the party. Others in attendance were the former national vice chairman, south, Hillard Etta, former governorship candidate, John Owen and former Senate Majority Leader, Ndoma Egba. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING!
