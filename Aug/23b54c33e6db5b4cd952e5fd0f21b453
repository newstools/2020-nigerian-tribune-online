I am a 19 -year old student. My problem is that I have been having epileptic seizures for over a year now. I have tried all types of medications (herbal and pills) to no avail. Kindly help me to know what else I can do. Ibrahim (by SMS)  Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterised by repeated seizures. Typically, the known causes of seizure involve some injury to the brain. However, in up to 70% of all cases of epilepsy in adults and children, no cause can be discovered. Although the underlying causes of epilepsy are usually not known, certain factors are known to provoke seizures in people with epilepsy. Avoiding these triggers can help you avoid seizures and live better with epilepsy. These include; missing medication doses, heavy alcohol use, the use of cocaine or other drugs such as ecstasy; lack of sleep as well as other drugs that interfere with seizure medications. It is therefore important for you to avoid the above pitfalls as well as bright, flashing lights and other visual stimuli. You should also take all of your medications as prescribed by your doctor.
