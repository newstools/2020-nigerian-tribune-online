The Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) has reiterated its commitment to support Lagos Deep Offshore Logistic Base (LADOL) in its Maritime, Health, Agriculture and Logistics operations in Nigeria. Executive Director Marine and Operations Hon. Onari Brown stated this recently during his familiarisation tour of the LADOL Zone in the company of the Port Manager, Lagos Port Complex, Mrs. Funmilayo Olotu According to the NPA ED, “I am really impressed with what I have seen today, and I think I will be more supportive. Now that I have seen, I think we will engaged more, we will talk more. “Talking about agriculture, I am so impressed because in every country, the major thing that can cause the highest crisis is food insufficiency. Somebody that has eaten well could wait for better times to come but when somebody is on lockdown and does not have food in his house, he will leave that house and go out to look for food. “In this time of COVID-19, Nigerians have come to realise that we cannot rely on crude oil and need to grow our maritime sector. Throughout the period of the pandemic, when countries were closing down their airports, no country thought about shutting down their seaports. The ports were all operating and that was what sustained the fight against COVID.” In his own presentation, the NPA’s AGM for Operations,  Ayodele Durowaiy stated that “This is my first time to LADOL and I can see physically that a lot is going on and going into Agro-business, and I am happy that LADOL’s vision has expanded from looking at the West African sub region to looking at the whole African continent.” Commenting on LADOL’s corporate social responsibility, CSR, the Managing Director of LADOL, Dr. Amy Jadesimi said since inception, the company has engaged with local communities to create an understanding and work with them on a meritocratic basis.
