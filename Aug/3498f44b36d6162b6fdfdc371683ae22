An Upper Area Court, sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos, on Tuesday, sentenced a 30-year-old driver, Victor Jonah, to two years imprisonment for stealing a car. The Judge, Lawal Suleiman, sentenced Jonah after he pleaded guilty to stealing the car. Suleiman, however, gave the convict option to pay N50, 000 or to spend two years in prison. He said the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such criminal act of stealing.
