Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has granted pardon to 17 inmates in the Sokoto Central Custodial centre. The gesture is part of government’s thrust as encapsulated in its Committee on Prerogative of Mercy protocols. Making the announcement on behalf of Gov. Tambuwal, the state Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, Suleiman Usman (SAN) made the announcement that: “the pardon takes cognisance of the executive powers vested on the governor to offer mercy to inmates by the 1999 Constitution as amended.” According to him, the gesture which is also aimed at enabling the ex-prisoners to reunite with their family members and become decent citizens was also intended to decongest the prison and protect the inmates from being affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. The commissioner called on the pardoned inmates to shun vices and engage in viable ventures that would uplift their living standards.
