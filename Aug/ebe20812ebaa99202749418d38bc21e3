In line with its mandate to promote a Digital Economy, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy in collaboration with the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has developed a Draft Policy Document on Virtual Meetings and Engagements in the Federal Civil Service. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami disclosed this on Tuesday, while delivering his address as the Guest Lecturer at the Course 82 graduation ceremony, National Defence College Abuja. He emphasized that the COVID-19 Pandemic has forced Nigeria to adopt the use of technology in governance which has also necessitated the need to promote e-governance in an orderly manner. Dr Pantami remarked that the draft document is ready to be presented at the Federal Executive Council in the coming weeks.

Dr Pantami who further advocated the preference of skills over qualifications remarked that global business and tech giants have since adopted the strategy, as individuals with proven skills remain more valuable than those with mere qualifications.
