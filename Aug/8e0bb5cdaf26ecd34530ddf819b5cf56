The State Independent Electoral Commission (ODIEC) on Tuesday, invited all political parties participating in next Saturday’s local government elections for the inspection of sensitive materials at its office. Speaking during the inspection of the sensitive materials, the ODIEC Chairman, Prof. Yomi Dinakin, while addressing representatives of political parties, said the display of the sensitive materials became necessary ahead of the election on Saturday. He assured that the materials would be taken to a secured location after the briefing and would be distributed to various locations from there. The ODIEC boss urged the political parties to be vigilant and ensure their agents were present during the distribution of the materials on Thursday, saying the commission would be neutral as an umpire for the election. Dinakin tasked the politicians to report to ODIEC if they noticed insufficient materials or the materials did not get to the polling units. He also charged them to raise alarm if they suspect electoral malpractices or anybody found smuggl9 ballot paper or boxes or trying to doctor results to the polling units. His words, “We called you to see the availability of these materials and not a census. We have more than enough. They are as they were brought from where they were produced. We are not here to take a census of the materials.
