One Taoreed Akano was shot dead in Ibadan, on Monday, by suspected armed robbers. In the incident which occurred at about 1.20 pm opposite Oyo State Environmental Task Force office, Agodi, Akano was trailed on a bike from a Guaranty Trust bank in Bodija after he had gone to make two withdrawals of N150,000 and N296,000. Noticing that he was being trailed, Akano was said to have swiftly turned onto the Secretariat to Government House road but the two armed robbers on a bike fired shots to dispossess Akano of the money while also making away with the victim’s Bajaj motorcycle. When Tribune Online got to scene of the incident, the bullet used on Akano by the armed robbers was seen on the blood-smeared road as well as the withdrawal slips and a palm sandal. Some staff of the state Environmental Task Force rushed Akano to Adeoyo state hospital, Yemetu, where he gave up the ghost. Oyo Police Public Relations Officer, Gbenga Fadeyi, who confirmed the incident, said Akano’s corpse had been deposited at Adeoyo hospital’s morgue. He further disclosed that two mobile phones and the sum of N90,000 was recovered from the late Akano. He, however, said the police was on the trail of the hoodlums while urging residents of Ibadan to assist with credible information.
