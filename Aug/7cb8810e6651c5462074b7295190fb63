The Uyo Zonal Command of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has taken over 33 victims suspected to have been trafficked and camped in two premises in Calabar. In an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday, the Uyo Zonal Commander of the agency, Mr Nduka Nwawene said the suspected victims were rescued in a joint operation by security agencies. “A joint operation by personnel of the 13 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Department of State Security (DSS), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) raided the two suspicious premises in Calabar. “One of the premises in Dame Winnie Akpani Street, Federal Housing Estate (FHA), Calabar belonging to Mr David Odeta, also known as G-Coach, while the other which served as a training base, was a popular resort in the state capital. “NAPTIP is currently in the process of determining which victims comprise 17 females and 16 males are being used, in spite of the COVID-19 restrictions.

Nwawene, however, added that the three suspects were still with the DSS but would be handed over to NAPTIP since they had taken over the victims. He said this would enable them to properly establish the element of human trafficking before proceeding to prosecution. (NAN) NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Jobs! Jobs!!
