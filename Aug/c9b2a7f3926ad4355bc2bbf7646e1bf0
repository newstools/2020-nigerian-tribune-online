Former governor of Ogun State and current Senator representing Ogun Central District at the National Assembly, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has expressed sadness over the death of Senator Buruji Kashamu. Amosun, in a statement by his media assistant, Alhaji Bola Adeyemi, said Kashamu would be remembered for his assertive presence in the nation’s political arena. “Death, once again, has robbed us of the contributions of an enigmatic politician of the PDP, who represented Ogun East Senatorial District at the 8th Senate, our dear brother, Senator Buruji Kashamu. “Although we belonged to different political persuasions, and disagreed on most issues, Senator Kashamu will nonetheless be remembered for his assertive presence in the political arena and uncommon doggedness. “He fought myriad of wars with every breath in his soul in the defence of whatever he believed in and for his personal freedom. Hate him or love him, he could not be easily ignored.” Senator Amosun prayed that the Almighty Allah will forgive Kashamu’s earthly sins and give him eternal rest. He expressed condolences to the nuclear and political family members of the late founder and financier of the Omo Ilu Foundation, the Ijebu Igbo Community, and Ogun State as a whole.
