The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), has denied media reports of N9 billion frivolous spending in the agency’s Internally Generated Revenue. The General Manager, Public Relations, NCAA, Sam Adurogboye while speaking with newsmen in Abuja, was responding to what he called misrepresentation of facts in the ongoing public hearing on the 2021-2023 MTEF/FSP organised by joint Senate Committee on Finance and Planning.

Adurogboye said there was no way the NCAA could indulge in frivolous expenditure as he noted that the agency’s IGR collections were domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as required by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAuGF).
