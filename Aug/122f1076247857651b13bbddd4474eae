The commissioner said that the decision became expedient because of fire incidents the state had witnessed in recent times. He said the agency was to coordinate the activities of fire authorities across the length and breadth of the state. Also, Dr Wasiu Olatunbosun, the Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, said the council gave approval for online verification exercise for pensioners who were in Diaspora. According to Olatunbosun, the council has directed the consultant in charge of the verification exercise to also capture the pensioners who are out of the country in the ongoing civil servants/ pensioners verification exercise.
