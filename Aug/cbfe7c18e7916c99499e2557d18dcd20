The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), has said that digital identification would fast track issuance of its facilities across the country. The Service’s Public Relations Officer (SPEO), Mr Sunday James, said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Friday in Abuja. NAN reports that the Federal Government had on June 13, announced that it was opting for a digital National Identification Card instead of the plastic card that was in use. James said that NIS had expressed the determination to keep the record of their National Identification Number (NIN), to ease facilitation of services. He said that NIS was elated and optimistic that when fully implemented, the digital identity would serve as an advanced identity solution. This, he said, would also be more secured and easier to access by service providers due to its credibility and reliability.
