A 27-year-old man, Inalegwu Ochekwu has been nabbed by police for allegedly raping a 10-year-old girl, simply identified as Franca. The rape incident was said to have happened in Otukpo town in Benue State, last Saturday. A social activist, Mrs Julie Okoh, who reported the case at Otukpo Divisional Police said that the 27-year-old man was an apprentice dry cleaner. The rape victim who spoke on tape said that the suspected rapist pounced on her when she went to the man’s shop to look for her sister. According to Franca, “When I went to their shop, to find out whether he had seen my sister, the man said no, but as I was about to go, the man grabbed me. “As I was shouting asking what was happening, he carried a cloth to cover my mouth and I struggled with him. He pressed me down, tore my cloth and forced himself on me and my body was stained with blood.” When contacted, the State Command spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, said she was yet to be briefed about the rape incident. According to her, “I have not been briefed, because I have been busy with recruitment exercise.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE North May Back Atiku In 2023 — Yakassai •Says APC should pick Southerner as presidential candidate •‘Tinubu better than Buhari who has no plan’ IF former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, contests for the presidency in the next general election in 2023, the majority of the votes from the North will go to him, elder statesman and politician, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, has said. Yakassai, a former Liaison Officer to former President Shehu Shagari, described both Abubakar and former Lagos State governor, Senator Bola Tinubu, as potential 2023 presidential contenders… Buhari Suspends Babalakin As UNILAG Pro-Chancellor, Sacks Acting Vice-Chancellor President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council of University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr Wale Babalakin, SAN and the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, over the lingering crisis… LOOK!
