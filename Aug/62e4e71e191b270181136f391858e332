With the recent easing of lockdown measures by the government, the general belief among many people is that the COVID-19 Pandemic is over. In view of this, many people have stopped using facemasks and washing their hands. Kindly let me know if this assertion is true. Rabia (by SMS)  With hundreds of new cases being reported every day by the NCDC alongside sustained community spread, rather than decreasing, the COVID 19 infection rate is still on the increase in Nigeria. Unfortunately, people who have been exposed to the infection are avoiding going for tests to avoid being stigmatized. Therefore, rather than relax preventive measures such as social and physical distancing as well as regular hand washing exercise and the use of facemasks, these activities should be sustained and encouraged. In addition, people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves when they do.
