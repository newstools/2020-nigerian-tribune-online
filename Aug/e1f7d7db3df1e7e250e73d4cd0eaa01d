Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has unveiled plans to generate a whopping sum of N29.2 trillion revenue from oil and non-oil sectors over the next three years, owing to the country’s capacity to sustain crude oil production average 2.2 million barrel per day in 2021, 2.3mbpd in 2022 and 2.5mbpd in 2023.
