However, Kaisha, after eviction when speaking with Ebuka, said she expected to be evicted because the housemates did not like her. Kaisha Umaru Chinemerem is a native of Sokoto State, born by a mother from the eastern part of Nigeria, but on a plane. She considers herself an adventurous person who doubles as a great team player. She has cooking talents and wishes to be a wife and mother in the next five years. Her favourite Nigerian musician is Wizkid.
