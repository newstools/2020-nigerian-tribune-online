The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has called on the Federal Government to implement the 2019 Memorandum of Action (MoA) it signed with the union. ASUU also urged the government to release fund for the revitalisation of the Nigerian university system for the development of the education sector. Prof. Theophilus Lagi, the ASUU, Abuja Zonal Coordinator, made the call during a news conference on Monday in Abuja. Lagi said the ongoing strike by ASUU was to demand the release of the revitalisation fund, payment of arrears of Earned Academic Allowance and constitution of visitation panels to public universities, among others. According to him, the quest for the revitalisation of the university system and the welfare of ASUU members have always been on the front burner of the union’s struggle and cannot be compromised.

The zonal coordinator hailed the Federal Government’s step to address the crisis that recently engulfed the University of Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Federal Government had on Wednesday inaugurated a seven-man panel to investigate the circumstances that led to the removal of the university’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, by the University’s Governing Council on Aug. 12.
