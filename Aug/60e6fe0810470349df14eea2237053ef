The Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) has called on the National Incomes, Salaries and Wages Commission  (NISWC) to urgently forward the recommendation of the Technical Committee on Pension review in line with the last consequential adjustments of workers’ salaries to President Muhammadu Buhari for immediate approval. Addressing the media after a meeting between the NUP national headquarters and the NUP Parastatals Sector in Abuja on Tuesday, Elder Alex Abu, the Chairman, All Sectoral Units and Parastatals of NUP, said the meeting frowned at the purported registration of another trade union by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, in contravention of the extant Labour laws and in utter disregard for the existing mother union (NUP) which is already catering for the interests of all civil and para-military pensioners in Nigeria, including all the parastatals. According to him, the meeting further restated and pledged its commitment, support and loyalty to the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) as the main umbrella body of all pensioners groups in Nigeria, including the parastatals.

This is moreso as the sector had never at any point in time been approached or consulted over the purported regrouping or registration of a new union by any group of persons to carve them out of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP)  which they are already comfortable with.” The meeting berated the Minister over the purported registration of FEPPAN against the wishes of the majority of members of the parastatals pensioners, and despite the ongoing court cases and several court injunctions against the registration. He said: “The meeting seriously advises all government agencies in charge of pensions, especially PTAD, to respect the collective decision and right of freedom of association of parastatals pensioners as being currently constituted. “Finally, the meeting hereby directs all parastatals pensioners under the auspices of NUP to dissociate themselves from any event or activity organised by FEPPAN.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING!
