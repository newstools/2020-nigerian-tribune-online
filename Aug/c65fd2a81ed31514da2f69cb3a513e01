The Ogun State Police Command will soon begin a house-to-house search for illegal arms in the state. This was disclosed by the State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, while parading suspects on Monday, at the Command headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta. Ajogun said the search followed the directive of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, that all Commissioners of Police in the country, must recover illicit arms, arrest and prosecute anyone in possession of such arms. He, therefore, urged criminals to handover illegal arms and ammunition to the Police, warning that the Command would not condone any act of lawlessness in any form from any individual or group. 38 suspected criminals were paraded for various crimes such as robbery, murder, cultism, rape and kidnapping, while locally made pistol, charms, live ammunition were recovered from the criminals. The CP said the suspects were arrested from different parts of the state between July and August.
