At the Bankers’ Committee meeting on Tuesday, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele announced plans to meet chief executives of multinational companies in Nigeria, to discuss the revamp of Nigerian exports. He noted that CBN was ready to encourage the revamp of Nigeria’s export sector through deliberate policies that would boost investment and job creation. According to a statement from the apex bank, Emefiele decried the situation where many Nigerian produce of export quality were waiting to be tapped and stated that CBN, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, would ensure the facilitation of a reboot of the Nigerian export market. Alluding to President Muhammadu Buhari’s charge for Nigerians to produce what they eat and eat what they produce, the CBN governor reiterated that the country had no choice but to diversify its economic base away from heavy reliance on crude oil. The meeting is expected to come up with a roadmap on how best to revitalize the export sector in order to earn foreign exchange for the country, as well as generate jobs for millions of Nigerians. Emefiele had earlier initiated a campaign tagged ‘Produce, Add Value and Export’ (PAVE), especially for the agricultural produce.
