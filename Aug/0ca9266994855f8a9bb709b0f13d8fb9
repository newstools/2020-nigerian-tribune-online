Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), on Tuesday, clarified that the Finance Act 2020 has striped both Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and NIPOST of the responsibility for collection of stamp duty. The explanation was contained in a reaction to a Monday tweet by the chairperson of the NIPOST Board, Mrs Maimuna Abubakar, accusing the FIRS of stealing NIPOST idea on stamp duty. Abubakar who tweeted from @ref_ng had alleged that FIRS @firstNigeria stole its mandate as regards collection of stamp duty. “I am worried for NIPOST, having sleepless night because of NIPOST, we need the general public to come to our aid, FIRS stole our mandate..#justicefornipost, she tweeted. But, reacting to the allegation in a statement, Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad, FIRS Director Communication & Liaison states thus: “The attention of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has been drawn to a tweet by Mrs Maimuna Abubakar, Chairperson of the Board of NIPOST.
