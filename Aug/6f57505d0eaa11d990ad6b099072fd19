Late examination commencement characterised the start of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), in Oyo State, on Monday. Across various schools visited in Ibadan, the state capital, the General Mathematics examination did not begin at the 9.30 am scheduled time. At about 9.45 am at Bishop Phillips Academy, Iwo Road, examination papers were still being sorted while candidates waited with bated breath for their question papers and answer booklets. A similar scenario played out at Monatan Secondary School, Iyana Church, Ibadan whereas at 10.10 am, examination materials were still being awaited. However, there was compliance with COVID-19 protocols, especially the use of facemasks, social distancing and washing of hands, by candidates, teachers and invigilators. Speaking on adherence to COVID-19 protocols of social distancing, Principal, Methodist Secondary School, Bodija, Mr Ajadi Akinbola, said social distancing will enhance the integrity of the examination as candidates had no opportunity to ‘giraffe’. Principals of some of the schools visited maintained that such lapses were inevitable on the first day of the exam. They, however, expressed optimism that the lapses will be corrected in coming days for fair conduct of the WASSCE.
