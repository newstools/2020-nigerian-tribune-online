I have been having fever, general body aches and loss of appetite for the past five days. Although I have commenced treatment with some malaria tablets which I purchased from a Chemist, I am still worried if what I have is actually Malaria fever and not COVID-19 infection.

Also, both COVID-19 and malaria infected individuals may be asymptomatic for a long time while transmitting the infections through their respective modes. In spite of these differences in presentations, a malaria case may be misclassified as COVID-19 if symptoms alone are used to define a case during this emergency period and vice versa. The definitive way to correctly identify a COVID-19 case is through a laboratory test.
