President Muhammadu Buhari has extended heartfelt condolences to the family, government and people of Adamawa State on the passing of Ambassador Wilberforce Juta, second civilian governor of old Gongola State. A statement issued by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President in Abuja, on Sunday, said the President also commiserated with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on the demise of one of her founding fathers, who ably served the country with dedication as High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, at the return to civilian rule in 1999. The statement said that as a teacher, politician and Christian leader, who was actively involved with the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN), President Buhari affirmed that Ambassador Juta was very passionate about the development and stability of the country and never took for granted the need to promote peace, harmony and religious freedom. The President noted that as a professional teacher par excellence, Ambassador Juta tutored and prepared many Nigerians for leadership roles of today and tomorrow, including Mr Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, who was his former student. “In recognition of his outstanding roles in the education sector, as a school principal, the elder statesman was once honoured as the Best Principal in the North East,” the statement recalled. It informed that President Buhari’s thoughts and prayers are with the Ambassador’s family, friends and the people of Adamawa State in their time of grief, even as he prays for the repose of the soul of the departed patriot.
