Former governor of Delta State, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, has debunked a report linking him to obtaining a road contract from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state said at no time did he obtain any contract to executive any job for the agency. In a statement signed by his Media Assistant, Mr Monoyo Edon, Uduaghan described the allegation of the road contract within Port Harcourt as not only false but ridiculous.

Dr Uduaghan has never approached the NDDC for any contract whatsoever. It is even more ridiculous that the said contract is a road inside Port Harcourt town. “Dr Uduaghan has drawn the attention of the Hon. Minister of the Niger Delta, Sen Godswill Akpabio to the publication and hopes he makes a correction. “Members of the public are advised to disregard the mischievous publication,” he advised.
