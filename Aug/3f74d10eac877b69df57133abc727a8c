The Federal Government says there is no sacred cow in the fight against corruption and being a serving member of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration will not be a shield for any corrupt individual. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed made this assertion on Thursday when he featured on News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum in Abuja. Mohammed was reacting to question on corruption allegations in some key government agencies and the implications on the anti-corruption fight, a cardinal programme of the Buhari government. “The very fact that the administration can very transparently ask for members of the administration to be investigated, I think it is the clearest proof that this administration’s fight against corruption has no sacred cow and that nobody is exempt.

The minister hailed the National Assembly for their cooperation and harmonious working relationship with the Executive. He also appreciated the legislators’ concerns on various issues including security, while expressing the hope that they would continue to enjoy a robust partnership.
