I am a 35- year old married woman with three kids. I have been having a good s3xual relationship with my husband for the past ten years. Even though I don’t have any pains, I recently noticed some fresh blood anytime I have s3x with my husband.  Kindly let me know the cause of this and what to do about it. Caroline (by SMS) Bleeding after s3x can be a sign of an underlying disease such as; Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), or a s3xually Transmitted Infection (STI) or Chlamydia. It can also be caused by: Vaginal dryness (atrophic vaginitis), damage to the vagina, such as tears caused by childbirth, or by dryness or friction during s3x. Other causes include cervical or endometrial polyps as well as the presence of an inflamed area on the surface of the cervix. In rare instances, bleeding after s3x can be a sign of cervical or vaginal cancer. In view of the above, it is important for you to see your doctor for a proper examination and appropriate tests. It is also important that all women aged 25 to 64 get regular cervical screening tests to help prevent cervical cancer.
