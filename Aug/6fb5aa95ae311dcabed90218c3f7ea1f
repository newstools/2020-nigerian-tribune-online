He was a loyal party man and committed democrat, with a deep understanding of the state’s political landscape. He was an extremely loyal politician, who did his best for our party, the All Progressives Congress. “Chief Razak served his people and Lagos State passionately as Chairman of Epe Local Government Area and Commissioner of Public Transportation. He brought a lot of development to Epe as a council boss and also made a lot of positive contributions to turn around public transportation in Lagos during his tenure as a member of the State Executive Council. “Chief Razak was a great politician, a strong party man and an advocate of masses oriented programmes. His support for our T.H.E.M.E.S. agenda was exemplary. He always propelled us to do more for the people of Lagos State. “There is no doubting the fact that he would be missed by the entire political class, particularly the people of Epe, the Lagos East Senatorial District and the State as a whole.” The governor also condoled with the immediate family of the departed, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; other GAC members, Lagos APC and the entire people of Epe praying God to grant the soul of the beloved Chief Razak eternal rest in Aljannah Firdaus.
