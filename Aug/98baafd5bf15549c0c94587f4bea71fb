Youths in Ogun State, on Monday, protested the indiscriminate killings of residents on Imowo Road, Epe Garage through Oke Owa-Ilese Ijebu and others within Ijebu Imusin area of the state. The youth also protested the killing of residents by cement trucks who ply Ijebu Ode roads. CEO, RERE Foundation for Progress and Development, Barrister Oluwasegun Adesanya who led the protesters said: Our attention has been worriedly attracted by the spate of killings that have become a weekly occurrence on Imowo road, Ondo road, Olisa, Oke-Owa, and other roads within and outside Ijebu Ode areas of Ogun State in the last five months or so. “These incidences have been made possible and seemingly unstoppable because of the unpassable and unmotorable nature of the roads in the axes mentioned above. Of course, the same is the fate and situations of other roads in Ijebu East LG and even beyond. Adesanya said the truck drivers have left their objectives of improving construction to murder and maim hard-working youths who eke a living off commercial motorcycle business. It is only timely that they are re-oriented and re-taught how to use these poor roads cautiously with other road users without causing bodily harms or death to innocent souls. “Many children have been orphaned while ladies turned widows at the early stages of their lives due to reckless driving by these drivers.” Adesanya further urged the state government to declare a state of emergency of the roads, adding that road infrastructure is a major catalyst to a robust economy,” adding that good roads will largely reduce the incidences of unwanted killings and maiming of its citizens.
