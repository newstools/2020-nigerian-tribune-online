Determined to boost the nation’s domestic gas consumption, the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) has put machinery in motion to set up 500,000 barrel of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, (LPG). The Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari who spoke yesterday at Ologbo, Ikpoba Okha local government Area of Edo State during the inspection of Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility promised that the plant, which will be commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 31 will curb importation of gas into the country. “Around a year ago, NPDC was producing about 136 000 barrels per day, today we are producing 260.000 barrels per day. Our target is to take this company to the production level of 500, 000 barrels per day,”. “We have lined up projects and activities, today we have the highest number of rings running in this country. Five rings  running at the same time, this will ultimately lead to producing that 500 000 targets,” ALSO READ: Edo: Oshiomhole can’t request troops deployment ― PDP He stated that NPDC is a company owned 100 per cent by Nigeria and would deliver it to be the number one upstream company in this country. He said they are trying to contain importation of LPG, noting that Nigeria is blessed with gas resource and can’t be importing LPG when the nation has all resources. He said: “Today we are making about 5 billion scuffs of gas into the entire domestic market which includes the NLNG supply of about 3.5 billion, the balance of 1.5 billion or a little more than that come to the domestic market. That is shared between power and industries.” Kyari promised that with the support of all the relevant stakeholders most especially from President Muhammadu Buhari, NPDC was poised to become the number one upstream company in the country. He said one of the major challenges confronting the company was that of critical infrastructure, adding that the state-owned corporation was presently building infrastructure that will be owned by NPDC. Mr Mansur Sambo, the Managing Director of NPDC noted that with the completion of the project, shortages of gas will now be a thing of the past in the country. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE LOOK!
