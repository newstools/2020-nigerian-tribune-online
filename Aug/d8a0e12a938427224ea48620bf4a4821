The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned what it sees as the renewed clampdown on the media and gagging of free speech in our country by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government. Making the condemnation in a statement issued by Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, in Abuja on Friday, the party insisted that, without prejudice to the allegations or claims the Federal Government has against Nigeria Info, a broadcast station, on issues of content, the Federal Government cannot, on its own, impose sanctions against a media house or individuals for expressing their right to free speech. The PDP held that if anybody, be it the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a state governor, a Senator of the Federal Republic, a Member of the House of Representatives, a public entity, or even the most ordinary Nigerian, have been libelled or infringed upon by any other Nigerian, the process for redress is clearly stated in the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and should be followed.
