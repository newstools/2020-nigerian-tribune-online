Traditional rulers from Anambra State were at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Thursday, to express appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for his commitment to the development of the country in general, and the South-East in particular. The monarchs were received by Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, who thanked them for coming, adding that the gesture would encourage the President to do even more for the region and the country as a whole. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity) on the meeting quoted Professor Gambari as saying: “As it is generally said in most parts of the country when you thank somebody for what he has done, he is encouraged, and does more. This is an incentive for the President to do more for the country, and also for the South-East.” ALSO READ: No organisation can succeed without security – Ajaokuta sole administrator The royal fathers listed the landmark projects embarked upon by President Buhari in their region to include “the Second Niger Bridge, that had been presented as an impossible task by previous administrations, but now becoming a reality under your keen watch,” the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, among others. “The people of the South-East are, indeed, grateful, as we have never had it so good, and on their behalf, we say DAALU (thank you),” the Royal fathers declared.
