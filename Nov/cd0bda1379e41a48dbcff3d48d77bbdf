The Presidential Task Force on the COVID-19 pandemic, during the last briefing, expressed concern over air passengers returning from abroad who failed to present themselves for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test as required by COVID-19 guidelines. The Chairman of the Taskforce, Mr Boss Mustapha, said statistics emerging from records show that only one out of three passengers have shown up for the in-country test. “The PTF similarly announced sanctions as a consequence of any infraction. Having observed serious non-compliance to the level of 65 per cent, the need has arisen to activate the sanctions which include the suspension of the passports of such defaulting individuals for a period of six months minimum,” he said.
