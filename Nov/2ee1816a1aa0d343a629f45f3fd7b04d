The Kano State Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA) has said it has concluded arrangement to recruit about 700 personnel to add to its 2,500 workforce in the state. Disclosing this while speaking with pressmen, the KAROTA Managing Director, Baffa Dan’agundi, said the new recruits will be deployed to the new emirates of Rano, Karaye, Gaya and Bichi in the state. According to him, the deployment was to ensure compliance with traffic rules in the emirates. He further disclosed that the KAROTA would soon partner with Kano Road Maintenance Agency (KARMA) in the repair of roads within the metropolis and beyond. Dan’agundi, however, said the agency has also created zonal offices within the metropolis to enhance coordination of the easy flow of traffic. He cautioned against the possible return of street hawking in non-designated trading spaces in the metropolis, warning that violators would face the full wrath of the law. He said: “We are strict with ensuring those street hawkers who were evacuated do not return back to cause unwarranted hardship on Kano road users.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE ICYMI: CBN Lists Business Activities Eligible For N75bn Youth Investment Fund THE Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed main business activities and sectors in the Nigerian economy that are eligible to access its N75 billion Youth Investment Fund… #EndSARS: Fr Mbaka Asks Buhari, Past Leaders To Apologise To Nigerians Controversial Catholic priest and Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Nigeria, (AMEN), Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka, has taken a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari and past leaders of the country demanding that the President should apologize to the country, especially the youths, on behalf of himself and his predecessors, for causing Nigerians so much pain… NEWS ANALYSIS: Arewa House Parley: Any 2023 Connection?
