The Presiding Judge of Kaduna High Court sitting, in Zaria, Justice Kabir Dabo, has ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear the case filed by Bashir Aminu (Iyan Zazzau) against the appointment of Ambassador Ahmad Nuhu Bamalli as the new Emir of Zazzau. This was even as it adjourned the case to November 5, 2020. When the case came up on Monday, the judge after hearing the arguments presented to the court by both the counsels of the plaintiff and defendants ruled that it has the powers to entertain the case. Thus, he adjourned the case to November 5, 2020, in order to allow interlocutory injunction filed by the lawyer of the plaintiff, Ustaz Yunus on behalf of the defendant. It will be recalled, that the state government had filed a motion before the court challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the suit brought it. Meanwhile, the coronation of the new emir is slated to take place on November 9, 2020. A source at the palace who pleaded for anonymity revealed that the palace is taking a new leaf as the renovation of the palace has commenced in earnest. Apart from that, he said invitation cards had been sent to important dignitaries across the length and breadth of this country.
