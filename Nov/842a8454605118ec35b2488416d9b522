Thirty-six people have been detained at an unsanctioned march of right-wing extremists in Moscow, news portal ovdinfo.org reported on Wednesday. The nationalist demonstrators gathered in two locations in the Russian capital without obtaining licences beforehand, the report said, adding that security forces later dispersed the crowds. Right-wing nationalists often use Russian Unity Day on Nov. 4 to promote their vision of an ethnic-nationalist state. Speaking at a meeting with representatives of different religions to mark Unity Day, President Vladimir Putin said extremists were trying to sow “hate and hostility in Russia.” He said Russians were “jointly obliged to do everything possible to rule out such a development in our country.” (dpa/NAN) YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Money laundering: Dismiss Mompha’s no-case submission, EFCC tells court The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has beseeched Justice Mohammed Liman of the Federal High Court in Lagos to dismiss the no-case submission filed by suspected internet fraudster, Ismail Mustapha, also known as Mompha, who is standing trial over an alleged N32.9 billion fraud. right-wing extremist FCTA bans #EndSARS protest, street demonstrations in Abuja The Security Committee of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has banned all street demonstrations, protests and processions in the territory, including the EndSARS protest.
