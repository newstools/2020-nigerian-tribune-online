I am a 54- year old man. My problem is frequent waist pain. I have used different pain relief drugs but I have not seen the desired results. The pain comes and goes. Kindly advise me on what to do. Godwin (by SMS)  Your waist pain could have been caused by the fact that you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. You could also have a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it usually takes a while to treat it.  Since you have used different pain relief drugs without any improvement, it will be advisable for you to see your doctor who will order some tests such as Xrays and other laboratory tests in order to confirm the actual cause of your ailment. The diagnosis will then dictate the kind of treatment you will undergo for the condition. In addition to the treatment, it is also advisable to start sleeping on a hard surface, such as a mattress on the floor.  Once you’re feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you — and your back — more mobile and pain free.
