Following the wave of #EndSARS protests which engulfed the country for about two weeks, Nigerians have continued to come out en masse to narrate their experience at the hands of the disbanded police unit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). One of such persons is rapper and singer, Jay3 Warsoulja, who disclosed to R that he was also a victim of police brutality years back while commending youths for speaking up in such organised fashion. “The bravery and oneness of the youths of this nation deserve commendation, especially in the face of outrageous brutality and misconduct on the part of the nation’s law enforcement. “I was a victim of such in 2016, it was a terrible experience and only such an experience can make one understand the terror. While the government should be commended for disbandment, we need more reform of the entire force. “The youths are wide awake now and calling for reforms. Our able leaders should respond to the outcry and do right by the people who voted them into power.” Warsoulja, who also runs his label, WMG Group, has a single, ‘Bimolemo’, which is currently doing the rounds on airwaves and music charts.
