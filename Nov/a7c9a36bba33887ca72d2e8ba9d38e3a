For Sijibomi Ogundele, Managing Director Sujimoto Group, taking into account the time value of money remains a good measure of sound investment decision. He made the assertion in Lagos while addressing a group of young emerging entrepreneurs. Ogundele said that the best time to invest is now, he explained that his experience has taught him that one cannot afford to leave today’s investment decision for tomorrow’s uncertainty. Ogundele sharing one of his experiences with the entrepreneurs said: “2 years ago, I was invited by one of this ‘big egbons’ to own a part of Sujimoto, I offered him 10% at Two billion Naira, he exclaimed no! and gave excuses. “Today he has re-invited us, offering Five Billion Naira for same 10%, but I have started my offer from 10 Billion Naira, and I’m not moving 1 kobo. You must have the eye of a Warren Buffet, and see the intrinsic value in others” The real estate czar said that every entrepreneur must have an eye for opportunities and not afraid to take calculated investment risks.
