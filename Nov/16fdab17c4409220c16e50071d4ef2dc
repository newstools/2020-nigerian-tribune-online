The House of Representatives, on Monday, quizzed the Comptroller General of Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammed Babandede, over the payment of multi-million naira insurance premium on grounded aircrafts in 2014/2015. Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Hon Woke Oke, who presided over the investigative hearing into the audit queries issued by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (oAuGF), demanded evidence for payment of the insurance policy, adding that there was no evidence of appropriation for the insurance policy on the two aircraft. Other members of the House Committee on Public Accounts, also queried the rationale behind the payment since the Board members were in doubt over the justification for the payment on aircrafts that are not air-worthy. In his response, the NIS Comptroller General, who was NIS Board Member, affirmed that the two aircrafts were grounded as at the time he assumed office in May 2016. He, however, noted that the two aircrafts have been handed over to Nigeria Air Force to prosecute the war against Boko Haram, as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari. According to the audit query raised by the Auditor General, the NIS Comptroller General was requested to recover the sum of N8.464 million and furnish the recovery evidence for audit verification; explain and provide evidence of N20.179 million paid to NIS officers for the conduct of promotion examination of CONPASS 7 to 16, in contravention of Financial Regulation 631 which provides for electronic payment to individuals.
