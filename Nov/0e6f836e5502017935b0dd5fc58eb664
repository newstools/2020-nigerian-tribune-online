Helme and his son Martin, who is the country’s finance minister, have drawn heat for comments on a Sunday radio show, in which they questioned the legitimacy of Tuesday’s elections. Those showed former vice -president Joe Biden beating incumbent Donald Trump, although Trump has also questioned the outcome. Helme also called Biden a “corrupt character’’ in the broadcast.
