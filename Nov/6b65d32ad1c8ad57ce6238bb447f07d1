The Speaker of the Bauchi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman has been elected as the new chairman of the Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria. The election of Suleiman followed the constitutional end of the tenure of Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, whose executive committee was elected at a meeting of the conference held in Lagos in August 2018. The constitution of the conference stipulates a two-year term of office for its elected leadership which rotates between the north and the southern part of Nigeria. At a meeting held at Reiz Continental Hotel in Abuja late Thursday, Rt. Hon. Obasa, who, in 2018, took over from the Speaker of the Kebbi State House of Assembly, Ismail Kamba, formally handed over to Suleiman, who is now saddled with leading the conference for the next two years.
