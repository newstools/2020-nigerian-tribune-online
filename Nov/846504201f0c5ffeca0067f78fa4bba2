We hear about how parents remain concerned about suitably preparing their children for financial success in the future. However, while a large majority discusses or covers the issue at hand, they fail to inculcate suitable life lessons or financial literacy for their children which leads to multiple issues later on. From online investment platforms to discussions revolving around family finances, there is a lot that you can do for preparing your kids for financial success in the future. As they say, learning something is always easier when an individual is a child as compared to learning the same as an adult at a later stage. This is highly applicable in terms of financial literacy as well. A study in 2018 by the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign discovered that a whopping 36% of young adults had sizable financial risks. Additionally, the study discovered that just 22% of people between 18-24 had proper ideas about what investment avenue is and was financially stable, i.e. they were better at planning out their finances, possessed savings/checking accounts and were less likely to make use of expensive alternate solutions like loans and payday lending. The remaining 78% were not as comfortable as surveyed by the University and even amongst those who were financially comfortable, they were moderately comfortable regarding overall financial literacy levels. These are issues that may affect the future generation since many young people are entering working lives and adulthood without proper financial abilities for securing their futures.
