FIVE top Deposit Money Banks (DMB) namely: Access Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank and Union Bank Plc have surprised the market with cumulative gross earnings record of over N2 trillion in nine months in 2020. This is contained in their various third quarter (Q3) 2020 unaudited results for the period ended September 30, 2020. The banks delivered strong top-line figures despite a challenging and fast-changing macro and banking landscape, occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent decline in oil price. Access Bank recorded gross earnings of N592.8 billion (+15% y/y), on the back of a 100 per cent year on year  (y/y) growth in non-interest income to N217.5 billion, buttressing the effectiveness of its strategy and capacity to generate sustainable revenue. Despite the high cost of operating the enlarged franchise and an increase in net impairment charge, Profit Before Tax (PBT) stood at N116.6 billion.

According to the unaudited account which was presented to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), this growth was driven by non-interest income which grew by 11 per cent  to N173 billion from N157 billion recorded at the end of Q3 2019, reflecting the group’s increasingly diversified business model. The group’s Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose marginally to N177 billion at the end of Q3 2020, representing a one per cent growth over the N176 billion posted in the corresponding period last year. Guaranty Trust Bank Plc released its Q3 2020 unaudited results for the period ended September 30, 2020. Key highlights show that gross earnings grew by 1.3 per cent to N328 billion from N324 billion in the previous quarter.

The lender’s net assets grew by 9.9 per cent from N687 billion to N756 billion.
