According to him, the youths made a very clear statement that highlighted inherent problems undermining the growth and development of the country including the shortcomings of the security apparatus that encourage arbitrariness especially by SARS Unit of the Nigeria Police Force. He said that the #EndDSARS protests have equally sent clear signal to leaders of the need to be responsive to needs and aspiration of the masses to uplift the quality of life as well as improve the welfare of security personnel to promote professionalism. Okeke-Ogene, while reminding youths that continuous destruction of public and private property will worsen the level of hunger and poverty in the land, appealed to security agencies, especially the police force to returned back to their duty post for the sake of the helpless Nigerians. He also urged other state governors in the country to emulate Willie Obiano, humanitarian gesture. #EndSARS NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that
