DEAR Nigerians, I write to remind us of when our very own citizens of the greatest country in Africa, Nigeria were being humiliated and killed in South Africa. Their livelihoods were also destroyed bringing them down to nothing. Without doubts, if I am right, we back home here were unhappy not to mention other Nigerians in other parts of the world. This suggests to me that we love each other and also comfort each other in time of crisis. I am appealing we stand united, making sure we do not lost focus on what our leaders believe and fight for, ‘A better Nigeria’ Let us once again prove it to the world that, though we have our problems as a nation yet but we stand united as one, despite the diversity in culture. This makes us the greatest nation on this earth. A new Nigeria comes with a new beginning, not just about praying and fasting. It’s about Peace Resolution. Only Nigerians can solve Nigeria’s problems. The New Nigeria will prosper and I believe so. So once again, I am appealing we stand united, flying high our flag of pride and honour which identify us as true citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
