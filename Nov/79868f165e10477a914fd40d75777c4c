DETERMINED not to be left behind in the era of digital economy and other digitisation processes, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi State, has concluded arrangements to establish a faculty of computing alongside the existing computer science programme,  just as Huawei has established an ICT Academy in the university. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Mohammed Abdulaziz, who made the disclosure during the donation of laboratory equipment by Huawei company to the university, stressed that digitisation was the in thing the world over. He noted that 5G connectivity would be economically beneficial to the country, considering the fact that speedy performance would enhance digital economy delivery services across the country. The vice chancellor said, “while we are still struggling in Nigeria to migrate from 3G to 4G, other countries were aiming for a higher digital efficiency by migrating to 6G, adding “we cannot afford to be left behind in the emerging digital world.” Professor Abdulaziz then commended Huawei company for selecting ATBU as the centre of digital excellence in the North East sub-region. Presenting the laboratory equipment to the university, Nigeria representative of Huawei, Kenneth Igwe, explained that his organisation was collaborating with Nigerian universities in order to promote digital connectivity. Igwe said the collaboration had given many Nigerian students the opportunity to visit Huawei headquarters in China for further research and development studies, stressing that the importance of digital research could not be overemphasised in the development of the country.
