Some angry Federal Government employees, on Monday, stormed the office of the Head of Service of the Federation (HoSF) over the delay in the payment of their salaries. The workers drawn from different federal ministries and parastatals besieged the office at the Federal Secretariat Abuja, demanding to be paid what was due to them. Consequent upon the action, the Federal Government has now given reasons for the delay in the payment of October 2020 salary to civil servants assuring that necessary steps have been taken to resolve the matter. According to a statement issued by Olawunmi Ogunmosunle, Director Information, on behalf of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, explained that the delay was due to the fact that the 2020 budget was passed before the conclusion of negotiation on the new Minimum Wage and its consequential adjustment.
