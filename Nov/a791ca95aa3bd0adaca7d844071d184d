Reports from the area on Thursday had it that two of the Communities namely Ette and Umuopu are all at the border between Enugu and Kogi States. According to the Disease Surveillance and Notification Officer in the Local Government Area, Vincent Oshomi, the cause of the strange deaths is not yet known although he told reporters that the Enugu State Ministry of Health has been alerted and specimen of the affected persons in the communities collected for proper diagnosis and treatment. Oshomi also disclosed to newsmen on Thursday that the disease broke out at Ette at the beginning of September 2020, and spread to the border community of Umuopu, where 20 persons had died. He further explained that the victims presented symptoms such as convulsion, diarrhoea before vomiting blood, adding that they are suspecting Lassa fever or cholera.
