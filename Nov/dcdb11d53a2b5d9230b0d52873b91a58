According to a statement authorised by Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the FCT Minister, Anthony Ogunleye, and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the figure was contained in the 2021 Appropriation Bill presented by Mr President to the National Assembly on October 8, 2020. The statement quoted the minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello of disclosing this when he presented the FCTA 2021 National Capital Budget to the Senate Committee on the FCT, on Thursday at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja. Malam Bello said the allocation was to sustain the implementation of critical projects both in the Federal Capital City (FCC) and the Satellite Towns. He also presented a list of 28 proposed priority projects to be funded from this budgetary proposal which he said is intended for the completion of on-going projects. “In their selection, the priority of attention was accorded to the completion of on-going projects. Accordingly, the entire projects in the 2021 budgets are for on-going projects,” he stressed. Some of the projects to be funded from the budget proposal amongst others, according to the statement, include the construction of the Southern Parkway from the Christian Center to Ring Road One, Rehabilitation and Expansion of the Outer Northern Expressway Project Lot II (Kubwa Road from the Federal Civil Service College to the Villa Roundabout), Rehabilitation of and Expansion of the Airport Expressway (project Lot I) and the completion of the International Vocational Institute, Utako and four comprehensive Science and Technical Colleges in Abaji, Gwagwalada, Kuje and Karshi.

This is to ensure the commencement of commercial activities at the national monument. Speaking on the 2020 budget, the minister said its performance was impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic. He revealed that the pandemic necessitated the downward review of the initial allocation of N62,407,154,360.00 to N29,657,154,360.00. Of this sum, he said that N15,000,000,000.00 representing 51 per cent has so far been released. Speaking earlier, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the FCT, Senator Abubakar Kyari lamented the fact that the annual budgetary allocation to the FCT has declined over the years and said that his committee, in discharging its duties will be transparent, fair, courageous and always be guided by the dictates of the constitution and rules of parliamentary convention.
