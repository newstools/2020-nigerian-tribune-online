Twenty-six Katsina women rescued from kidnappers said they were forced under gunpoint to trek for 3 days inside the bush before finally getting to the kidnappers’ den. The middle-aged women and young girls who were rescued by neighbouring Zamfara State authorities said their village, Dan-Aji in Faskari Local government area was attacked by the bandits and after killing several people, they were kidnapped. “We have never witnessed terrible times in our life, like what happened that day, said Nusaiba one of the kidnapped women.” The rescued girls were received by Katsina State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Bello Masari who showed his appreciation to Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Bello Mutawalle.

In his remark, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran, the commissioner for security and home affairs of Zamfara State who conveyed the kidnapped victims to Katsina said the women were rescued with the help of some repentant bandits. “The intervention of Zamfara State Governor has always led to the freedom of abducted citizens without the payment of ransom by any party. “Through his dialogue and reconciliation process, several groups of armed bandits have laid down their arms and embrace peaceful coexisting in the state.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Money laundering: Dismiss Mompha’s no-case submission, EFCC tells court The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has beseeched Justice Mohammed Liman of the Federal High Court in Lagos to dismiss the no-case submission filed by suspected Kidnapped Katsina women SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
