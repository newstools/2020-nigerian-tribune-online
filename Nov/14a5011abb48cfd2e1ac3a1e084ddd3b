The Kano State government has approved the conversion of Muhammad Abdullahi Wase General Hospital in Nasarawa Local Government Area of the state to Yusuf Maitama Sule University Teaching Hospital. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the hospital was initially named after a former Military Administrator the state, the late Col. Abdullahi Wase. The Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the university, Prof. Mukhtar Atiku, announced the conversion plans during an inspection visit to the hospital on Thursday. He said that the state government had approved the conversion long before his appointment as vice-chancellor. Atiku said that the hospital had to undergo a series of accreditation by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) and the National Universities Commission (NUC).

Earlier, the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the General Hospital, Dr Mustapha Hikima, said it had all the facilities and equipment required of a teaching hospital. He solicited for the support of the vice-chancellor in fine-tuning the modalities for actualising the take-off of the teaching hospital. (NAN) NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
