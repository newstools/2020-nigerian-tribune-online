In his opening address, CoS to the President, Prof Gambari said the president was aware of the level of destruction in the South-West in the aftermath of the EndSARS protest, and the reason he encouraged that the dialogue should hold to chart the way forward. According to him, it is from the engagement that report would be made available to Mr President for implementation, urging that the presentation should be open and frank.
