The Commission advised the Officers and men of the Force to ignore the message and go about their normal duties in line with the rules of engagement in dealing with the civilian Public According to the statement, “the attention of the Police Service Commission has been drawn to a social media message inciting Officers and men of the Nigeria Police to go outside its rules of engagement in dealing with the Civilian Public “Part of the message read; ” every Police that dies for civilian again, he is on his own … Do the needful police work and remain alive for your children and families” “The Commission feels that this moment does not call for incitement but for a complete renewal of faith in the Nigerian project. The Police are expected to conduct themselves with the highest degree of patriotism and in obedience with its rules of engagement “The Commission is doing its best to see that the welfare of the Officers and men are enhanced and worthy of their sacrifice to the nation. “The Commission is also seeking a complete and comprehensive overhaul of its logistics so that it will be equipped to discharge its constitutional responsibilities. “The Policemen are enjoined to note that they are required to play a leading role in the search for peace and progress in the country. “The commission once again commiserates with the families of officers who lost their lives and wishes those who were injured during the crisis a quick recovery.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE ICYMI: Presidential Panel On Police Reforms Agrees To Meet All Demands By #EndSARS Protesters The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has convened a meeting with stakeholders and has agreed to meet all demands raised by the #EndSARS protesters, which include halting use of force against protesters and unconditional release of arrested citizens.Don’t be incited against Civilians  Don’t be incited against Civilians ICYMI: Lagos To Compensate Victims Of #EndSARS Protest With N200m ― Sanwo-Olu Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the state government has earmarked N200million as compensation for families of victims of #EndSars protest.Don’t be incited against Civilians  Don’t be incited against Civilians ICYMI: I Was A Victim Of SARS Brutality Twice, Oyo Deputy Gov Tells Protesters Oyo State deputy governor, Mr Rauf Olaniyan revealed that members of the Nigerian Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have attacked him twice.Don’t be incited against Civilians NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
