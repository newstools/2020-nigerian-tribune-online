Johnson said: “When they came to our house wearing F-SARS T-shirts, I asked them to show their identity cards, but the told me not to burden them and that I should marry another husband because the man I am living with will not return back alive again.” She said that her husband who was the breadwinner of the family is an indigene of Aguleri community. His death was confirmed to me when I approached the Anambra State High Court along with my lawyer few months after his arrest. “I am using this opportunity to appeal to this honourable panel to investigate and compel the Police authority to pay a reasonable compensation to my family for upkeep and my husband’s proper burial,” she said.
