He argued that Omatseye, being an Ijaw, who are noted for their swimming skills, could not have drowned in a two-feet swimming pool. “We want to know how our colleague died. Jeffery was to graduate in a few weeks’ time but suddenly lost his life in a hotel swimming pool. “All students should stay away from that hotel,” he warned. A colleague of the deceased who’s also 500-level law student of the school, Emeni Fidel, demanded justice for the dead. “Jeffery was a friend and was popular among the students. The circumstances surrounding his death are not known, which is why justice must be done,” he averred.
