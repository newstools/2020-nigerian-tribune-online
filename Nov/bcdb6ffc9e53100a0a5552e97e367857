Governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State during the July 20 primary have condemned the wanton destruction of public and private property by hoodlums in the state during the #EndSARS protest. The aspirants who made this known during a visit to the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, said though the constitution of the country recognises the right of citizens to table their grievances by way of peaceful protests, but noted that the destruction witnessed during the protest had rubbished the cause of genuine #EndSARS peaceful protesters. Speaking on behalf of the governorship aspirants that participated in the primary election, Chief Olusola Oke said: “Given the state of our economy, it’s unacceptable for anyone to have destroyed assets. “While sympathising with the government and people of the state, we condemned this in strong terms.” ALSO READ: NEPAD seeks NASS support to combat poverty, reform Congratulating Akeredolu on his victory in the September governorship election, the leaders promised to join hands with him to ensure development in the state while they promised to continue to sustain the unity in the state chapter of the party and make it stronger for future elections. The aspirants commended Akeredolu for laying a solid foundation for the new Ondo State, saying the state would be second in a few years’ time. Responding, Akeredolu commended the aspirants for their show of solidarity, saying their support accounted and responsible for the party’s victory at the October 10 governorship election. He, however, described the wanton destruction that trailed the #EndSARS protest as worrisome. Those who visited the governor included Chief Olusola Oke, Ambassador Sola Iji, Mr Isaacs Kekemeke, Prince Jimi Odimayo, Chief Olayide Adelami and Mr Akinsehinwa Apata.
