In spite of her losses, a businesswoman, Mrs Tonia Gbemre, whose shops were demolished by the Delta State Ministry of Lands, Surveys and Urban Development on Friday, has donated N100, 000 to one Mrs Ella Ellington, one of her tenants who was a victim of the demolition. Tribune Online had, on Friday, reported that over 11 shops belonging to Gbemre located at Plot 1, Block 1, New Layout Estate, Ugboroke in Uvwie Local Government Area were demolished along with property inside the shops worth millions of naira. Rather than bemoaning her own losses to the demolition, Gbemre over the weekend decided to donate N100,000 to Mrs Ellington who is heavily pregnant on compassionate ground to ameliorate her suffering because of the loss of her means of livelihood. Mrs Ellington, a graduate of Mass Communication, who was doing her baking and catering trade with about six apprentices in one of the demolished shops, also had her equipment destroyed too. She narrated to journalists, amid tears, that her husband recently lost his job and the situation had been made worse by the destruction of her shop and equipment which her family of four had been solely depending on. While receiving the money from Gbemre, Ellington thanked her for the gesture, noting that the money would help to ameliorate her pains and revive her petty business.

I am calling on the state government to come to our aid,” he pleaded. Meanwhile, Gbemre has again, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to help her bring to book those who she accused of being behind the destruction of her property. “I want to use this opportunity to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to come to my aid,” she said.
