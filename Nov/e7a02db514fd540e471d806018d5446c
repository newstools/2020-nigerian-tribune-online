The Defense Headquarters (DHQ), on Monday, said that the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has neutralised several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters and destroyed some of their structures, including a suspected fuel storage facility, at Tumbun Allura, a terrorists’ logistics hub on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno State. This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, DMO, Major General John Enenche. Gen Enenche explained that the air raid was executed on Sunday on the heels of credible Human Intelligence reports as well as aerial surveillance missions which led to the identification of a command post as well as a suspected fuel dump, with a large number of jerry cans and barrels concealed in makeshift structures within the settlement. He said that consequently the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attack aircraft, dispatched by the Air Task Force to engage the location, scored accurate hits in the target area resulting in the destruction of the terrorists’ fuel dump, which was seen engulfed in flames. Gen Enenche disclosed that several ISWAP elements were also neutralised during the airstrike.
