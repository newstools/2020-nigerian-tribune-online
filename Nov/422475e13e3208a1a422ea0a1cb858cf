A former emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi II, has refuted a story that his cousin was abducted, saying there was no iota of truth in the story published by a newspaper (not the Nigerian Tribune). Sanusi insisted that all his family members are safe in their homes. It would be recalled that a national daily had reported that one of the former emir’s cousins was abducted along Abuja/Kaduna Road. However, the former emir denied the story saying “All his family members are doing well.” Sanusi, who spoke in a telephone interview, said if the purported abduction happened, he would be the first person to release it to the media. He said, “In any case, I expect the media more specifically those who wrote the story to get in touch with me to verify the story before going to the press, and thereby endangering my family members.” However, there is a report that the person allegedly abducted was Aminu Musa Abdullahi, the son of a former Vice-Chancellor of Bayero University Kano, Professor Musa Abdullahi. However, the boy was said to have regained freedom from the kidnappers late last night.
