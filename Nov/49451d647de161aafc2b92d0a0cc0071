The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on Friday, said it has fully paid all amounts due to the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) but stressed that payment of the agency’s surpluses would be made upon completion of the ongoing audit of the Commission’s accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019. The House of Representatives committee on Power had on Wednesday threatened not  to approve the Commission’s 2021 proposed budget if it fails to pay all outstanding debts owed to the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) Managing Director REA, Ahmad Salhijo had told the Committee, Chairman,  Hon. Magaji Da’u Aliyu from Jigawa State, that one of the impediments faced by his agency in the discharge of its duties is the inability to get the operating surpluses from NERC turned over to it as expected under the law. But in its reaction, the Commission in a statement issued and signed management said it has fully paid all amounts due to the agency.
