Lagos State government, on Saturday, denied that it has revoked the occupancy title of the land on which Sheraton Hotels, Ikeja is located, describing the report as untrue. The government said this in reaction to report on some online media that it had revoked the occupancy title of land the multi-billion hotel is standing. The State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, made this clarification while speaking with Tribune Online on the telephone, saying what was revoked was the title of a parcel of land close to Sheraton and not Sheraton itself. “It’s not correct, what has been revoked is the title of a parcel of land close to Sheraton, not Sheraton itself. The land on which Sheraton Hotels stands is not revoked,” he said. “The the parcel of land that is revoked is closed to Sheraton but not Sheraton,” he reiterated.
