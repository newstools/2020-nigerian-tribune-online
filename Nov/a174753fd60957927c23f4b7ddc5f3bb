The Chairman of the South-West Governors’ Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Sunday, denied the allegations that state governors deliberately hoarded some food items meant to be distributed as COVID-19 palliative. Akeredolu explained that the insistence on official flag-off ceremony by the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CA-COVID) before the distribution largely responsible for the delay in the distribution of the items to the people. The governor made this disclosure during a Church Service marking the 3rd Year Enthronement of the Bishop of Owo Diocese, Anglican Communion, Stephen Fagbemi, held at the All Saints Church Idasen Owo. According to him, some of the state governors were also waiting for the donation of the remaining items and flag-off by the CA-COVID but described as unfortunate that the item were looted before distribution and maintained that the palliatives were not deliberately hoarded. He, however, said Ondo State was saved from the looting spree due to the continuous distribution of the palliatives. Speaking on his re-election, Akeredolu described his victory at the last month governorship election as God’s project which no man can truncate. He assured the people of the state to continue with developmental projects during his second term, saying that his re-election by the people of the state cannot be tampered with. Akeredolu also congratulated the Lord Bishop of Owo Diocese, Stephen Ayodeji Fagbemi, over the third anniversary of his enthronement as Bishop of Owo Diocese.
