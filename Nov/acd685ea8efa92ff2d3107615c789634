Automatic transmission systems have been the saviour of many modern car owners for a while. They started emerging in the late 20th century and eventually overtook vehicles with a manual transmission system by the 21st century. This type of transmission has won the hearts of many, mainly because the transmission shifts much smoother and quicker. The absence of a clutch pedal makes it less challenging to disengage the clutch of a vehicle. Drivers only need to be focused on steering in the right direction, braking and accelerating.  It also offers better fuel mileage and ease while driving in traffic with a ‘stop and go’ pattern. It may not be news that there is more to your vehicle with an automatic transmission than shifting the gear but what may be obscure are the various components that work together to form a complete automatic transmission system. For the fact that each constituent of this type of transmission system is vital, a fault in any of the components could affect the overall movement of your car. Here, we delve into the parts of an automatic transmission system and their primary function: Now that the inner workings of an automatic transmission system have been looked into, this piece will conclude with some recommendations to maintain it. Ensure that the vehicle’s transmission is topped-up regularly for proper lubrication. Make it a point to use the recommended transmission fluid for your car and have the entire transmission flushed routinely. Moreover, it is important that you do not change gears while in motion or drive immediately the ignition is turned on. This can cause serious damage to your transmission system. Finally, refrain from driving on a spare tire and using your passenger vehicle for towing, as this puts excessive strain on the transmission.
