The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), on Monday, inaugurated a 21-man Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Disposal of Federal Government of Nigeria’s Forfeited Assets. The committee, according to Malami is expected to sell off all assets forfeited in favour of the Federal Government within six months. Malami, while inaugurating the Committee said the President Muhammadu Buhari had given approval to the constitution of the committee, which is chaired by the Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice, Dayo Apata (SAN). Following the recommendations of the Presidential Audit Committee on Recovery and Management of Stolen Assets, the AGF said Buhari directed effective and efficient management of recovered assets, as an interim measure, pending the passage of the Proceeds of Crime Bill. “In compliance with the directives of Mr President, the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice issued Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 to provide legal and administrative frameworks for the investigation, tracing, seizure and disposal of stolen or illegally acquired assets and proceeds of crime. “The regulation was drawn from the extant laws of the relevant anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies. “It is aimed at ensuring proper coordination of the disposal of the Federal Government assets and for promoting a uniform, harmonised and transparent procedure to safeguard the assets recovered by the relevant agencies in line with the anti-corruption drive of this administration,” the minister stated. The terms of reference of the committee, he said include, ensuring the transparency of the disposal of Federal Government final forfeited assets and the synergy and collaboration between the AGF, law enforcement, anti-corruption agencies, other relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies and the Non-Governmental Organisations in the collation of records of all assets.
