Policemen killed and injured during the recent violent #EndSARS protests in the country will be promoted to the next level, the Inspector General of Police, Mr Adamu Mohammed has announced. Mohammed who disclosed this on Wednesday while addressing a cross-section of policemen at the Edo State Police Command headquarters during a morale-boosting visit to Benin ordered the police who have been absent from the streets to go back to their beats and combat the rising wave of crime. Coming on the appeal to policemen to go back to their beats by Governor Godwin Obaseki, the Inspector General said that he was fully in touch with the Police Service Commission (PSC) to ensure that those who either died or injured are promoted to the next level. He declared: “Arrangements are being made compensate the family of those who died and also those were injured during the #EndSARS protests. For those who died, adequate compensation will be given to their families and also promoted to the next level. Those who were injured will also get the same packages. We are working with the Police Service Commission to ensure that they are promoted.” Mohammed who reeled out some incentives approved by the present administration to boost the morale of policemen noted that over 60,000 retired policemen are poised to benefit from the health insurance scheme recently approved by the federal government. Against the backdrop of these initiatives and the new salary scheme for police officers, he tasked them to confront criminals headlong instead of vacating the streets for them to freely operate. He said: “You don’t need to be demoralized. You don’t need to vacate the public space for criminals to operate. You need to occupy everywhere. I know that some of your stations were burnt during the protests but the governor (Godwin Obaseki) has already promised to rebuild them.” The deputy governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu who reiterated the state government’s determination to cater for the welfare of policemen, echoed the Inspector General advise that policemen should not vacate the streets for criminals. Shaibu remarked that thugs did hijack what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by the #EndSARS protest and unleashed mayhem on peaceful Edo people, noting that the people are not against policemen.
