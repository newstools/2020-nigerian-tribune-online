The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has presented the Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) product quality certificates to Lafarge Africa Plc, Nigeria’s operations of the world’s leading building materials giant, LafargeHolcim (LH). The presentation comes after products from the company’s Mfamosing Plant satisfactorily met confirmatory and standardisation requirements set by SON. While presenting the certificates, Mallam Farouk A. Salim, Director General of SON, who was represented by Mr Ogbuji Michael Chukuwudi, State Coordinator, SON, Cross River State, commended Lafarge Africa for satisfactorily meeting the prescribed requirement for certifications and urged them to continually ensure high-quality control at all times. Mr Salim said: “Lafarge products at the Mfamosing plant were awarded the SON prestigious quality mark because they have met the prescribed requirements following the outcome of series of MANCAP inspections to the company and corroborative and extensive analyses.” He noted further that Lafarge Africa has been steadfast in ensuring that its products conform to requirements and therefore urged the company to ensure full utilization of the certifications. A major benefit of the SON certification to Lafarge Africa is hitch-free exportations to other countries, mostly on the continent. The Country Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge Africa, Mr Khalid El Dokani commended SON for their objectivity in affirming compliance of products at the Mfamosing plan. He also praised the hard work of his team and assured SON that the company will continually ensure strict compliance at all times.
