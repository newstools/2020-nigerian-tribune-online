Bandits on Monday killed a lawmaker’s uncle, abducted a newly wedded couple as well as 13 others in Safana local government area of Katsina State. It was gathered that the incident took place at Rumka village when the bandits stormed the village and killed Sama’ila Supa, an uncle of a lawmaker representing Safana in the State House of Assembly. Narrating how his uncle was killed, the lawmaker, Abduljalal Haruna, disclosed that his uncle, Mr Supa, was killed by the gunmen when he refused to be kidnapped. “One of them just pulled the trigger and hit him. He fell down and died on the spot,” he declared. Haruna also said that last night at Babban Duhu Community, the bandits abducted 13 people but seven of the abductees later escaped and returned home. Also, it was gathered that a newly wedded couple were abducted on Monday, just a week after their wedding ceremony. The groom and his bride were identified as Sama’ila Abdullahi and Zainab Isma’il respectively. Haruna said many others were shot and they are currently receiving treatment in a hospital. “All these are happening despite the presence of security personnel in the area where my uncle was killed. “The distance between where the security personnel are staying is about five kilometres to where the gunmen operated.” When contacted, the police spokesperson for Katsina State police command, SP Gambo Isah, said the police, as well as security personnel, were doing their best to secure the communities from these criminals. He appealed to residents to always cooperate with the police in order to identify informants, as well as suspicious characters in their communities. Jobs! Jobs!! Jobs!!!.
