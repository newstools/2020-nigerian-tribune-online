Union Bank Nigeria Plc has announced the retirement of its Chief Executive Officer, Emeka Emuwa, effective March 31, 2021. The bank, in a statement on Monday, said Emuwa communicated his decision to retire from the bank after serving as its CEO for eight years. The bank also announced Mr Emeka Okonkwo, who is currently an executive director, as the incoming CEO, subject to the approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Mr Emuwa joined Union Bank in November 2012, following a $500million investment by Union Global Partners, with a mandate to transform and restore one of Nigeria’s oldest institutions back to its rightful position as a respected provider of financial services. Commenting on his retirement, Emeka Emuwa said: “I have enjoyed the significant challenge of leading Union Bank over the last eight years. I am extremely proud of the management team and what we have been able to accomplish during my time as CEO. Today, we have a strong bank that is well-positioned to compete and deliver on its vision to be ‘Nigeria’s most trusted and reliable partner.’ With a clear strategic direction, a growing and loyal customer base and a strong brand, this is now the natural time for the next generation of leadership to take Union Bank forward and deliver further value. “In over three decades of banking, my time at Union Bank has been one of the richest experiences in a long and fulfilling career with a treasure of work and life lessons to carry into the future. Together as a team, we scaled many hurdles and accomplished significant feats and I would like to thank my executive team, senior management and every one of our employees for their integrity, support and hard work that have brought Union Bank to where it is today. I would also like to thank the board for the opportunity to lead this storied institution that has impacted generations of Nigerians for over a century and for supporting our efforts and vision during my tenure. “As we begin the transition into a new era of leadership under Emeka Okonkwo, a consummate professional with the right experience and values, I know that Union Bank will continue on its path as a value-driven organization that is deeply committed to our customers and the communities we serve.” ALSO READ: Security: Reps ask Buhari to release N3bn take-off grant for local production of ammunition Prior to joining Union Bank, Emeka Emuwa led a distinguished 25-year career at Citibank.

His exceptional contribution to the transformation of the business produced excellent results and set a solid platform for growth. The focus over the last eight years on technology transformation, digital innovation, and development of diverse markets for our world-class range of products, has seen Union Bank well positioned to continue growing from its current position as a market disruptor. Amid a tough macroeconomic environment, Union Bank maintained steady operational momentum under Emeka’s leadership which in 2020 culminated in the first dividend payment to investors and shareholders in over 10 years. “His many significant achievements, including providing steady stewardship during the unprecedented challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, lay a solid springboard for the future. We wish him the very best and are grateful for his support and commitment to ensure a successful transition over the next few months. “The board is pleased to have Emeka Okonkwo as incoming CEO.
