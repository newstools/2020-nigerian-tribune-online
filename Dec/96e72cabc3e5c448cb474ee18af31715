The Committee Chairman gave the breakdown of the capital expenditure as administrative sector N8,703,607,618.50, economic sector N54,591,303,577.68 while law and justice have N1.3 billion as earlier presented and Social sector got N16,234,508,748.72. He observed that the current budget structure is complicated making it difficult to trace a particular capital allocation for scrutiny and for oversight. Hon. Lokogoma noted that henceforth the names of Ministries, Departments and Agencies( MDAs) must be provided against each capital project for proper oversight while the budget was presented late that resulted in hasty scrutiny for speedy passage, just as he while thanked the house for finding them worthy to serve in that capacity. Meanwhile the Honourable Speaker, Niger State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abdullahi Bawa Wuse was represented by the Deputy Speaker representing Bida Constituency one at the presentation and passage. He thereby applauded members of the committee for a job well done and directed the Clerk of the House to provide five clean copies to the State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello for assent.
