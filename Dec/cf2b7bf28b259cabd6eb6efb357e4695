The second wave is more catastrophic because a lot of people have gone back to their ways of doing things,” Amodu said. The NMA Chairman, however, appealed to patients to desist from hiding their medical history to ensure the safety of health workers in the country. ‌Amodu said poor knowledge of patient’s medical history exposed some doctors to the pandemic. “To our patients, as you come to the hospitals, please oblige us. Wear your face masks, tell us the truth about your past medical condition. Stop holding any information back,” he added. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
