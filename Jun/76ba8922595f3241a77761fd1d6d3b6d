The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, on Monday, said that the chartered flight which conveyed musician, Naira Marley from Lagos to Abuja, was actually approved for a Lagos high court judge, Justice Adefowope Okojie. The minister, who stated this during the daily press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, said the aviation authorities approved the flight on June 14 having considered the judge to be on essential duties. According to him, he was then surprised that the flight which was to take off on June 14 and convey the judge took off from the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, for the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja, on July 13 at 6.00 p.m. According to him, “we wrote a letter approving the chartered flight for Justice Adefowope Okojie and we approved the flight for June 14. We were therefore surprised that the flight took off on June 13 and also surprised at those who were the passengers.” The minister said as of now, investigation is ongoing to know the pilot of the plane and those aviation officials who were around when the flight took off in Lagos and landed in Abuja.
