Not less than 73 inmates have been granted pardon by Bauchi State governor, Sen. Bala Mohammed as part of the celebration of the 2020 Democracy Day in the state. The governor announced this at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed Special Adviser on Legal Affairs, Barrister Kefas Magaji at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Bauchi. Bala Mohammed said that the release of the inmates is part of his administration’s desire to deepen democracy in the state. The governor said: “As part of our solidarity to the celebration of Democracy Day, I granted amnesty to 73 inmates, some government functionaries will also go round and assist less privileged citizens.” He assured that the State Executive Council would continue to work as a team in order to tackle the challenges affecting the progress and development of the state. “Our cabinet in Bauchi is a collective cabinet, we work together as a team and despite the modest achievements we recorded, we must do a lot as Bauchi is left behind because of sharp practices of the past,” the governor added. He then tasked the sworn in adviser on legal matters to justify the confidence reposed in him by assisting the state government to succeed on legal matters. The governor also enjoined Dr Aliyu Gital who was sworn in as special adviser on agricultural matters to come up with initiatives that will ensure effective implementation of government’s agricultural policy. Governor Bala Mohammed while expressing confidence in the ability of the advisers to deliver as expected, called on them to work in close collaboration with their respective commissioners to achieve the set objectives.
