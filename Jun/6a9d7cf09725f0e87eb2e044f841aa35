IMPORTERS operating at the Tin-Can Island ports of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) have incurred huge surcharges from shipping companies and terminal operators as the Nigeria Customs Integration System (NICIS2) server is currently experiencing operational difficulties. This server failure which has crippled business activities at the Tin-Can Island port have led to huge demmurage and storage charges for importers as processes of documentation for Customs clearance by clearing agents have remained very difficult. The Tin-Can Island Port is the second busiest seaports in Nigeria after Apapa. The port has five terminal operators with different concessioning agreements. Under the NICIS 2 platform, importers and clearing agents are expected to process their clearance documents right from the confines of their homes and offices. This was designed to reduce the level of crowd trooping into Nigerian ports and various Customs commands. One of the clearing agents at Tin Can Island Port, Mr. Adebowale Dare told newsmen that the server failure for the past two weeks has ensured that clearing agents visit the customs processing centre (CPC) popularly called “longroom” to generate their clearance documents. According to Mr. Adebowale, “You can be trying to capture a job for a whole day and the Customs website would still be failing. At the end of the day, you won’t be able to generate assessment. Even if you succeeded in generating assessment and capture your job, you won’t be able to generate C number, and If you are unable to generate C number, you cannot print out the assessment. At this stage, you would now be forced to go to the Customs Long-Room before they can generate it for you. Going to the Customs Long-Room breeds physical contact between importers and Customs officers, thereby promoting bribery and extortion. “Under normal circumstances, we are suppose to generate assessment and capture jobs right from the comfort of our offices, but now we are unable to generate C number due to server breakdown, and we are being forced to visit Customs Long-Room where anything happens. And once you cannot generate C number, demurrage and storage charges will start accumulating. This has been the situation at the Tin-Can ports for the past two weeks.” When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Tin-Can Customs command,  Uche Ejesieme, confirmed the server failure but added that the Customs server is being managed by Webfontaine in partnership with Interswitch, two technical partners of the Nigeria Customs Service. Ejesieme, further lamented that the command is also losing revenue to the server failures and that the Tin-Can Customs Command is more concerned even more than the importers.
