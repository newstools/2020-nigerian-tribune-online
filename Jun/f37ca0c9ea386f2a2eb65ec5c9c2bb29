Also, irate youths in Ampang District of Mangu local government over the weekend set the Police Station in the community on fire over alleged plan by the police to shield a man who was accused to be responsible for the disappearance of a trader’s manhood. It was gathered that on realising that the man’s manhood has disappeared, the suspect was taken to the police station for justice and possible restoration of the missing manhood. According to a source, while the police were trying to resolve the matter, youths in the community besieged the police station insisting that the suspect be released to them for jungle justice but the police refused to assent to their demand. “But when the police discovered that the youths were becoming unruly, they invited Operation Safe Haven in charge of security in the state which whisked the suspect away. At this point, the youths descended on the police, overpowered them and set the building ablaze,” the source said. Attempts by Tribune Online to confirm the incidences from the State Police Public Relation Officer, ASP Ubah Gabriel, proved abortive as several calls put across to him were not answered.
