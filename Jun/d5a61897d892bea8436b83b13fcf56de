This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, DMO, Major General John Enenche. He explained that this was achieved through airstrikes executed on Saturday as part of subsidiary Operation LONG REACH after credible intelligence reports as well as days of aerial surveillance missions established that the settlement was being used as a staging area to launch attacks against friendly forces’ locations and surrounding civilian settlements. According to the statement, following this development, the Air Task Force dispatched a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets as well as an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft to engage the location. It stated that the NAF jets scored devastating hits in their multiple waves of attacks resulting in the destruction of several structures in the settlement as well as the neutralization of some of the terrorists. It added that the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, commended the ATF for their dedication and professionalism while the Defence Headquarters equally urged them to intensify the air offensive against the terrorists and all other criminal elements threatening the peace and security of the country.
