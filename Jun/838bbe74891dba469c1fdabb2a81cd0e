Although there has been no official confirmation from his family, there were reports on Thursday afternoon that the immediate past Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, is dead. One of his political associates and a member of the House of Representatives, Honourable Akin Alabi, tweeted: “Forever in my heart” illustrating it with the photographs of Ajimobi. A former member of his cabinet also confirmed his death, but said “everybody is waiting for the family to make the announcement.” The mood around his Oluyole residence was sombre this evening but there was no one ready to speak on the matter. There had been reports over the past week that the former governor was on life support at a private hospital in Lagos suffering from complications arising from COVID-19. The 70-year-old ex-governor was the Deputy National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) until the dissolution of the National Working Committee today in Abuja. Official confirmation of his death is being awaited from the family. More details soon……..
