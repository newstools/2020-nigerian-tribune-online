UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday that England could start gradually easing the COVID-19 lockdown thanks to a significant prevalence drop, adding that the 2-meter social distancing rule would be changed starting July 4. “Our cautious relaxation of the guidance is entirely conditional of our continued defeat of the virus. “In the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for COVID-19 across the UK. “By the first half of June, that token has fallen by 70 per cent to just under 22,000. “This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost.
