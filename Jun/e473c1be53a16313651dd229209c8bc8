The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) will collaborate with indigenous scientists in the development of drugs or vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country. Tribune Online reports that Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, NAFDAC Director-General, said the agency’s interventions would allow for documentation of such initiatives for global recording as potential vaccines or drugs that is in process or safety testing. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja, she said that the agency would open its doors to the team of Nigerian scientists that declared they are working on a vaccine for COVID-19. “It will be a great thing if Nigeria develops her vaccine, but all the steps stated above will have to be followed,” she said. According to her, it takes time to develop a vaccine and NAFDAC will be the first to be informed of any such developments in the country. “That testing will involve use of the virus and then animals. If all goes well, the researchers will then plan for a clinical trial which will take a long time from 18 months to years.
