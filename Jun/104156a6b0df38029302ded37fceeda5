The Lagos State government has disclosed that it rescued a mentally-challenged mother and her two children, male and female, who were sexually abused by an unidentified man in Idumota area of the state. Speaking on the Lagos State government twitter handle over the rescue which took place on Wednesday, the Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu, described the occurrence as very unfortunate considering recent media reports on reported rape cases involving children. He maintained that despite the increasing rate of rape cases of minors in some quarters across the State, the government remains unrelenting in its efforts to put an end to the vile act and prevent future occurrences. The Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Yewande Falugba, stated that as soon as the ministry became aware of the incident, immediate action was embarked upon to rescue the mother and the children. She reported that the two children believed to have been abused were taken for medical examination and treatment, adding that they are currently placed in one of the government-approved orphanages for adequate care pending completion of investigations into the matter. Falugba added that the mother of the two children, who was discovered to be mentally imbalanced, has since been taken to the State-owned rehabilitation centre for mentally challenged persons.
