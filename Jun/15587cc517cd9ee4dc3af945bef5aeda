The governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has presented his nomination form, seeking re-election on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) to President Muhammadu Buhari. The governor stormed the presidential villa, Abuja, on Monday, to see the president, brushing aside the controversy generated by his clash with his predecessor and National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. He told State House correspondents after the meeting that even though President Buhari is a father to all, it will be wrong to assume or take things for granted, “so I have to formally inform him.” The visit is coming ahead of the governorship primary election of the APC scheduled for this month. Oshiomhole is thought to favour former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, for the APC ticket.
