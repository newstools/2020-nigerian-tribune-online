The management of Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), said it never, at any time, issued any ultimatum to brand owners, manufacturers and importers, on the yet- to- be- launched Product Authentication Mark scheme, of the agency. The Director General of the organisastion, Osita Aboloma, in a statement, explained that the programme was still being fine-tuned by the agency, and awaiting final approval from relevant authorities. Aboloma urged manufacturers and importers to disregard the purported ultimatum, published in some news media, stating that the agency would, as usual, give adequate notice to stakeholders, prior to the launch of such programme. The Product Authentication Mark, he added, is being conceived to enable consumers take informed decisions, concerning the authenticity or otherwise of the agency’s  regulated products at the point of purchase, in tune with the agency’s roles of ensuring standards in the country. He added that the Mark would also help brand owners fight counterfeiting and adulteration of their products, as well as improve their market share and bottom-line. When introduced, the SON’s boss added, the programme would  complement existing quality assurance initiatives of the agency, such as, the  offshore Conformity Assessment Programme (SONCAP) for imported products, the Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) for made- in- Nigeria products and the Electronic Products Registration Scheme. He further assured stakeholders of the agency’s commitment to promoting Consumer safety, value for money, product competitiveness as well as ensuring a level-playing field for locally manufactured and imported products, in line with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) requirements.
