In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, the Ibadan Diocese of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), recently held its 2020 Synod by Zoom Video Conference. The synod, coordinated from the boardroom of the Diocesan Headquarters, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu House, Molete, had 80 other viewing centres hooked to it. In his presidential address, the Diocesan Archbishop, Most Reverend Olumuyiwa Odejayi, tasked the three tiers of government to seriously look into the issue of security challenges. According to Archbishop Odejayi, “the security and welfare of the people are the primary purpose of any government,” hence causes of insecurity should be adequately addressed by all concerned. He noted that the causes had led to the breakdown of family values, government’s failure in administering justice and fairness, sabotage amongst security personnel, porous borders and unemployment. He commended the efforts of the federal and state governments in combating COVID-19, just as he urged all and sundry to adhere to all safety measures. Odejayi, however, called on the Oyo State governor, Mr Seyi Makinde to extend the distribution of palliatives to the Church. Speaking on the synod’s theme ‘Here am I, send me’ (Isaiah 6:8b), the Diocesan Lay-President, Dr Olayinka Bolaji, urged Christians to be visionary, ready to embark on God’s assignments.
