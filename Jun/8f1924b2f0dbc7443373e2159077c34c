The Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, on Thursday, disclosed that only seven patients are currently receiving medical attention at its isolation centres. Coker stated this in her remarks when she joined the state deputy governor, Engr (Mrs) Noimot Salako-Oyedele, at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, to receive 300,000 face masks to the state government donated by a Chinese company. She explained that most of the patients, about 95 per cent are receiving home treatment, in accordance with the directive of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The commissioner noted that the seven patients are in the isolation centre due to their symptomatic status. “We are not short of bed spaces because as you know 97 per cent of our cases are asymptomatic and mild diseases and the NCDC directives now are home management for people with mild diseases. “So, you have about 300 people in the community that are being managed as home care, we are following them up and we have discharged so far about 400. “So, in the isolation centre right now, we have only seven patients as in-patients, these are patients requiring oxygen or requiring ventilation. “If you don’t require oxygen you could be managed at home, we used that opportunity to actually educate their family members on how to protect themselves and not getting infected. Salako-Oyedele commended the organisation for the donation, promising that the masks will be distributed for the good of the people of the state. The General Manager of the company, Mr Philip Seng, said the masks worth N100 million and that the donation became necessary to serve as one of the measures to prevent community spread of COVID-19 in the state.
