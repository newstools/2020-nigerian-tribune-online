President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed shock at the passage of Mrs Ibidun Itua-Ighodalo, wife of Pastor Itua Ighodalo of Trinity House, based in Lagos. A statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by Femi Adesina Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), said the president shares the pain and sorrow of the family at the sudden death and prays God’s comfort for the entire family, friends and members of Trinity House. According to the statement, Buhari recalled that Pastor Ighodalo was one person who faithfully prayed for the country, and the government, noting that he sent him a personal letter of condolence when his former Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari, passed away in April.
