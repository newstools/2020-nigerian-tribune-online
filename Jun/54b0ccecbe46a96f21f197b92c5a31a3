An unidentified woman has been seen struggling to survive at the Secretariat Bus-Stop going towards Toll Gate area of Lagos State. Tribune Online learnt that she had been there since Monday but no one has come to her aid. It was gathered that she was at the same bus-stop completely naked and lying face-down, when some good Samaritans later provided clothes for her and ensured that she bathed, before putting on the clothes which she later yanked off. It was learnt that an agency of the Lagos State government had come to see her in that condition on Wednesday, June 3, 2020, promising to come back and pick her, but up till Thursday, June 4, 2020, as the time of this report, nobody has come for her. Efforts at reaching the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) has been futile as calls were picked, but no action taken even up till the time of this report. This reporter even took a step further to reach the agency’s office where an agency called LASAMBUS claimed that there was no vehicle to pick her. The helpless woman was still at the spot in that condition as at the time of filing this report.
