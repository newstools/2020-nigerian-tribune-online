Senator Abiola Ajimobi faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has said that its faction of the National Working Committee will not participate in the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting scheduled for Thursday. The party in a statement jointly signed by Hilliard Eta, National Vice Chairman of the party and its National Secretary, Waziri Bulama, said this in a statement released Wednesday night, ahead of the Thursday convoked National Executive Committee meeting of the party as endorsed by the President. The statement reads: “We wish to unequivocally state that members of the National Working Committee (NWC) believe that the President was offered wrong advice or blackmailed into lending his weighty office to the illegality of the National Executive Committee meeting purportedly convened by one Victor Giadom on 25th June, 2020. “We hereby respectfully implore Mr President to kindly avail himself with facts of the matter regarding the impasse presently experienced by the party so as to guide him in his assessment of the matter because we are sure that the President if properly advised, would come to the conclusion that the meeting convened by Chief Victor Giadom bothers on illegality and criminality.” Giadom faction had on late Thursday evening got an endorsement of the Presidency over the planned NEC meeting which he has repeatedly said has the mandate to resolve the leadership tussle in the ruling APC. “The National Working Committee (NWC) regrets to turn down the invitation to the illegal and unconstitutional National Executive Committee (NEC) convened by Chief Victor Giadom. “We believe that attending such a meeting will amount to embracing illegalities and turning a blind eye to the infractions on the Constitution of our great party,” the statement reads.
