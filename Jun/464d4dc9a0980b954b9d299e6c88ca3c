The Police Command in Benue, on Wednesday, arraigned a 30-year-old man, Terseer Zashe, at a Makurdi Upper Area Court over alleged criminal conspiracy and armed robbery. According to the Police Prosecutor, Veronica Shaagee, the Police Command received a petition dated June 5, from V. T. Uji and Co Chambers, a law firm, on behalf of their client, Mr Michael Mbakuu, over the matter. Shaagee said that the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Makurdi, which acknowledged receipt of the petition, ordered for a discreet investigation into the matter. She explained that the defendant had allegedly conspired with his accomplices, Ortwer Akete, Aboade Iordye and Mbagune Anche, blocked the highway with woods and sticks, and attacked the complainant at Tse-Ugah. She said the suspects were allegedly armed with cutlasses, knives, sticks and rope when they carried out their operation.

The plea of the defendant was not taken for want of jurisdiction while the Magistrate, Ms Rose Iyorshe, ordered his remand at the Federal Correctional Centre, Makurdi and adjourned the case until June 25, for further mention.
