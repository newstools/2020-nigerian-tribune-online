The management of Redeemer’s University has frowned on the news of an outbreak of COVID-19 on its campus as reported by some media houses (not Nigerian Tribune) recently which has the potential of undermining its efforts at safeguarding the health of the nation through free medical services being provided by the Redeemer’s University African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases. According to a press release by the university’s Corporate Affairs Head, Adetunji Adeleye, the university as part of its routine check discovered through its clinical testing that one of its clients living outside campus has been exposed to Covid-19 and immediately activated all the mechanisms put in place to safeguard its spread and subjected all those people who might have had any contact with him directly or indirectly to necessary testing in order to ensure the safety of our environment.
