In order to address the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace and its impact in Nigeria, the umbrella body of Employers in Nigeria, Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has signed an unprecedented Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC). The MoU, Director-General of NECA, Dr Timothy Olawale said, through a press statement on Sunday, is aimed at pooling forces together to protect and promote the interest and welfare of workers both in the public and private sectors in these challenging times. “The COVID-19 pandemic has done significant damage to businesses and changed the dynamics of the world of work. As employers and workers are both directly affected by the pandemic, it became necessary to work together in addressing the critical labour and socio-economic issues arising from the pandemic, especially from the perspective of the Work-place,” Dr Olawale said. Speaking further on the imperative for MoU, the NECA Director-General explained that: “as Social Partners, whose overall interest is enterprise-competitiveness, protection of workers’ rights and development of national economy, the desire to pool reflections, initiatives, and actions in the fight against COVID-19 and any external threat to businesses and workers in the private and public sectors necessitated the collaboration. “It is no gainsaying that the rate of enterprises fatality and job loss due to COVID-19 was worrisome. The effects of the pandemic have escalated it to an alarming rate with large scale negative consequences for our nation.” The MoU, which was signed in the presence of International Labour Organisation (ILO) officials, Dr Olawale said, would enable the NECA, NLC and TUC work together post-COVID-19 to develop programmes with government and other stakeholders to ensure business sustainability and competitiveness, creation of decent jobs and rapid national development. “Today heralds greater understanding, collaboration and mutual respect between employers and workers and provides a joint platform to constructively engage government in the advocacy for a favourable business environment that will aid economic recovery in the short term and post COVID-19,” the NECA DG enthused.
