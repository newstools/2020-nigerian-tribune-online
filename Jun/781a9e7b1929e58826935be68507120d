The Nigerian woman who was advertised for sale on Facebook in Lebanon by a Lebanese man has refused to return home, according to the head of Nigeria’s diaspora commission. The woman was listed for sale at $1,000. She was rescued by the Lebanese authorities and taken to the Nigerian embassy in Beirut. The advert caused an outcry in Nigeria and the man suspected of involvement in the advert was arrested. The 30-year-old woman now says she has found another job in Lebanon. Commission head, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has said she tried to convince to return home but she refused. “Even the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) of Oyo State, where she is from, spoke to her. We just hope that Nigerians going to work in Lebanon will be properly treated and not treated as slaves,” Ms Dabiri-Erewa said. She said the Lebanese government had brought back 69 out of 79 Nigerians who were in Lebanon. The 69 are currently in quarantine. The Lebanese embassy stopped issuing visas to Nigerians seeking domestic work in Lebanon after the incident.
