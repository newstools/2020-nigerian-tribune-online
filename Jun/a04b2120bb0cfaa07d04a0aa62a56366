A Makurdi Chief Magistrates’ court has sentenced a 22-year-old herder, Bala Juli of Adadu Village in Nasarawa State, to a one-year jail term in a correctional centre for openly grazing cows in Benue. The Magistrate, Mr Isaac Ajim, summarily tried and convicted the defendant after he pleaded guilty of the offence. He, however, gave the convict a fine option of N500,000 because he was a first offender, but held that ignorance of the law doesn’t constitute a defence for an accused.
