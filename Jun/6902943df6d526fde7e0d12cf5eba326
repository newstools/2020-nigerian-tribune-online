The Federal High Court, Abuja, Monday, said it would revoke the bail granted Senator Shehu Sani if he fails to appear in court on the next adjourned date for the trial of the two-count criminal charges preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft agency is prosecuting Shehu Sani on charges, bordering on name-dropping and obtaining the sum of USD$25,000.00 from Alhaji Sani Dauda of ASD Motors, Kaduna, under a false pretence that he would use the sum to bribe the Acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, to shield Dauda from EFCC’s investigation and prompt the Commission to arrest and prosecute one Abubakar Musa who is having an issue with Dauda. At the resumed trial on Monday, defence counsel, A.A. Ibrahim (SAN) informed the court that the former Senator was not in court because his neighbour just died of COVID-19, following which the Kaduna State Government placed a movement restriction in the area. “My Lord, the defendant is unavoidably absent in court today because one of his neighbours died of COVID-19, and the government of Kaduna State placed a restriction of movement in the area, hence making him absent. In the circumstance, we are pleading with the court to give us a date,” he said. Prosecuting counsel, Abba Mohammed, who objected to the motion for adjournment informed the court that he had two witnesses in court and one of them came from the same Kaduna Shehu Sani complained about. The trial Judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo thereafter adjourned the case till July 6,7,8 and 9, 2020 for the continuation of trial.
