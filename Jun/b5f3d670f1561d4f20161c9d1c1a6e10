 FOR the Nigerian agriculture sector to continue to flourish, it is important for manufacturers of beverages which egg powder forms core part of their production to ensure that it is produced locally rather than importing. Chairman, Follhope Nigeria Limited, a multi-agro service company, Chief Emmanuel Folorunsho Ogunnaike, stated this while speaking with the Nigerian Tribune in Ibadan. He noted that doing this will guide against capital flight and further boost the Nigerian agricultural sector immensely. “Companies manufacturing beverages must be encouraged by the government to bring egg powder production machines to Nigeria instead of importing the very important commodity. “Doing this aside being an added advantage for them in terms of revenue will also create job opportunities for locals where these companies are domiciled therefore causing drastic reduction in the rate of unemployment.” He said. Ogunnaike, while lamenting the rate at which cooking oils are being imported into the country, said there is the need for government to discourage importation of cooking oils into the country since it can be produced locally and excessively. “For instance, in our farm, we have unharvested palm seedlings because the cost of palm oil production is higher than the selling price . If the government ban the importation of cooking oils, the market value for the ones produced locally will surely increase and will give room for profit. “As far I am concerned, there is no need for us to be importing cooking oils when we have abundance human and material resources to produce more than Nigerians can comsume.” While speaking on the fish production value chain in Nigeria, Ogunnaike posited that ban on importation of fish is also an important decision Nigerian government must consider. He noted that Nigeria can produce enough fishes capable of taking care of the market demand. He, however advised Nigerians to reduce their taste for foreign foods. “Most developed countries of the world patronise their locally produced foods and that is the reason their economy continue to blossom. “I remember during the reign of Olusegun Obasanjo as military Head of State, the only official car recommended was Peugot 504 because it was being assembled here in Nigeria. The sole aim was to encourage local production thereby boosting the economy. We should reduce our taste for foreign products until our technological skill can sustain our taste for them.”   YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING MONDAY LINES: America Has Trump; We Have Buhari
