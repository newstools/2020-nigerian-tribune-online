After months of lamentations, the Lagos State government has said it would reach out to the private school owners and their teachers with food items to cushion the effects of coronavirus pandemic and lockdown on them. The Commissioner for Education Lagos State, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, gave the assurance on a sideline at the commencement of the distribution of the home-grown school feeding palliatives to parents of pupils in primary 1-3 in Lagos State held at Saint Francis Primary School Maryland. According to her, the government is aware of the plights of private school owners and teachers and is already working towards reaching out to them with their own palliatives. When asked how soon this would be, she said certainly it would not be long as this is the period they badly need the support.
