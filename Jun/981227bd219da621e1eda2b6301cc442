Former Governor of Ekiti State, Chief Segun Oni has solicited a befitting posthumous honour for the late Group Managing Director of Odua Group of companies, Sir Remi Omotosho by the Ekiti State government. Oni, a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party, described Omotosho as an outstanding Ekiti patriot, saying bestowing honour on such an illustrious son would serve as an impetus for the coming generations. The business mogul and industrialist died after a brief illness on June 4, 2020, at the age of 75. In his condolence message on Saturday, Oni condoled with Governor Kayode Fayemi, the Ekiti State citizens, and Omotosho’s family over the demise of the Ayedun Ekiti born business mogul. Oni said: “I received with shock, the painful demise of our compatriot, loving brother, Sir Remi Omotosho who departed this sinful world. I offer my deepest condolence to his dearest wife, children, and the entire family and loved ones he left behind. “May God grants all of you the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
