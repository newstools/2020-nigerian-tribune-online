Less than 24 hours after his victory in the Edo State People’s Democratic Party (PDP) primary, the Chairman of Edo state Board of Technical and Vocational Education, Mr Christopher Adesotu, on Friday resigned his appointment from the administration of Governor Godwin Obaseki. In his letter of resignation to Governor Obaseki, through the Secretary to State Government (SSG), Mr Osarodion Ogie wrote that his resignation was to further his political aspiration. Adesotu’s resignation comes on the heels of similar actions by three members of the governor’s aides who have pulled out of the administration in the last two months. According to the letter dated, June 24, 2020, the former Chairman of Ovia South-west Local Government Area of the state, and a former Commissioner for Education in Obaseki’s government said that the resignation was with immediate effect. He expressed gratitude to the governor over the opportunity afforded him to serve in his government. The letter reads in part, “With profound gratitude, most respectfully, I humbly wish to inform your Excellency, that having deeply consulted with my conscience, family and friends, I wish to inform, Mr Governor of my intention to bow out from the services of the state government, though the decision is clothed with mixed feelings the necessity is hinged on my future political aspiration. However, without prejudice, this resignation takes immediate effect.” It would be recalled that the Chief of Staff to Obaseki, Mr Taiwo Akerele, had resigned his appointment stating administrative reasons. Similarly, Commissioner for Information, Mr Paul Ohonbamu and a Special Assistant, Mrs Emike Obaze resigned their appointments in June.
