Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on Sunday hosted his embattled Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki in a secret meeting at the Government House Port Harcourt. No details were revealed about deliberations between the two governors from the South-South region of the country, but it must not be unconnected to recent disqualification of Obaseki by the APC Edo governorship election screening committee and the speculated plans by the Edo State governor to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). News of the Sunday meeting was first tweeted by Wike at about 4pm when Obaseki arrived the Rivers Government House to elbow handshake with his host who ushered him into closed doors. The State Government is yet to issue any statement on the meeting, but Government House sources told out correspondents that the move was part of Obaseki’s swift consultation of power brokers in the PDP towards having a soft landing on a likely defection to the PDP from the APC.
