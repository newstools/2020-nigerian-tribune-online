According to him, with my bold decision to step down as CEO, for the tough contest to complement the efforts of the past and present administration in the state as a standard-bearer of PDP, I am fully ready to slug it out with whoever emerges the governorship candidate of the ruling All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), the All Progressives Congress (APC) and other political parties also vying for the number one seat. He noted that with the unify state executive, under the leadership of Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, the party was on the right path to producing the next governor of Anambra state after 14 years as an opposition. While acknowledging PDP recent donation of 120 million naira to cushion the effect of COVID-19  pandemic and other humanitarian services rendered so far to Ndi Anambra as opposition, Chief Ozigbo, expressed optimism that with the kind gesture, PDP was at the verge of harvesting a greater number of decamps from other political parties including APGA and APC.
