The old woman who was rescued from beside a gutter on a flooded street by the Kaduna State government was on Thursday reunited with her son and the entire family. According to the Kaduna State Ministry of Human Services and Social Development, the woman, Sa’adatu Adamu, was reunited with her son, Aliyu Adamu, at their family house in Kwarbai, Zaria, where she also met her grandchildren for the first time, according to the son. It was gathered that the son, who has two wives and 15 children, has made frantic efforts to remove him mother from the streets but the woman, who was said to be mentally challenged, has always resisted the move. According to the ministry in its twitter handle, “Sa’adatu Adamu was reunited with her family in Kwarbai, Zaria, yesterday. “Sa’adatu was once running a business at Kano road, Kaduna. Aliyu who had two wives and 15 children said he recently attempted to remove his mother from the streets, but she has always refused. So, this move by the ministry is one that they are happy about. “Some of her grand children were also excited to see her. Our social welfare officials examined the room meant for Sa’adatu and instructed a team member to monitor this reunion to ensure that adequate care is provided for her by her family.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING President Buhari’s Full Democracy Day Speech
