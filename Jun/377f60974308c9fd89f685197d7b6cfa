A school administrator and principal of Adesina College, Ibadan, Mr Adejare Adesina, has advised the Federal Government to liaise with the West African  Examination Council (WAEC) and other West African countries that subscribe to the council’s examinations to reopen schools for all the Senior Secondary School final year students immediately to sit the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination. He said the junior classes could stay at home for now to avoid unnecessary crowd and also to observe physical distancing and other measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19. Mr Adesina made the remarks in a chat with Tribune Education recently. He noted that COVID-19 had caused serious damages to the system, lamenting that the unwanted damages done to academics could have been minimized if the government or the authorities mandated to manage the crisis had consulted with school operators to deliberate on the issue before the total lockdown. He said the final year students who had about two weeks to commence their 2020 WASSCE should have been asked to go ahead with the examinations while the rest students should go home, adding that similar arrangement should have been made for the Junior Secondary School finalists, as well as those in the tertiary institutions. “By now, all the final students at the junior secondary and senior secondary school and even at the tertiary level would have concluded their academic programmes and the 2020 WASSCE would have been concluded this month of June,” he said. Mr Adesina said online education method is an ineffective substitute to the face-to-face contact teaching and learning, especially at the secondary school level, because of its deficiencies in terms of teachers’ supervision and concentration by the students. He said it had become very difficult for any Nigerian student at the secondary level to pass the certificate examinations at credit or distinction levels without teachers’ tutelage either by home lesson or classroom teaching. Adesina said Nigeria has not yet got to the level where its secondary school students can rely absolutely on online education, as the country is yet to create a conducive environment for online education programmes.
