Justice Mallong Peter of the Federal High Court Kaduna on Wednesday sentenced one Amos Matthew to four months imprisonment for impersonation. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Kaduna Zonal Office, had arraigned the convict on a one-count charge of impersonation. The prosecution, Mr S.H. Sa’ad, told the court that the defendant had initially pleaded not guilty on his first arraignment on Jan. 1, 2019. Sa’ad had asked the court to summarily try and convict the defendant following his plea bargain after he changed his plea to being guilty on the resumption of hearing on Wednesday.
