President Muhammadu Buhari has warmly felicitated former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe, on his 75th birthday. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), in Abuja, on Wednesday, said Buhari joined family members, friends and political associates to celebrate “the renowned diplomat, whose service to the nation has been exemplary.” President Buhari acknowledged Ambassador Kingibe’s laudable profile in public service, which include serving as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Power and Steel, and at various times Nigerian Ambassador to Greece and Cyprus, Pakistan, and African Union Special Envoy to Sudan. The President expressed the belief that the diplomat’s venture into politics was expedient as he played key roles in shaping the nation’s history, most remarkably sharing a presidential candidate ticket with Chief MKO Abiola in an election that has remained the crux of Nigeria’s democracy and continues to define the trajectory of leadership. President Buhari extolled Ambassador Kingibe’s “willingness to always answer the call of service in Nigeria, and the African continent, recalling how, from early years, he sacrificed his time and resources, working diligently as Principal Political Secretary in the Office of the President in the ’70s, where he contributed to the military transfer of power, states creation and birth of the Second Republic.” The President prayed that the Almighty God will continue to strengthen the renowned diplomat and bless his family.
