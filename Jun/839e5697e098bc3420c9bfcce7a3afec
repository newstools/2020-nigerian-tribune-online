Eminent Nigerians have continued to sympathise with the immediate family and the people of Oyo State over the death of the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Isiaka Ajimobi. The Kebbi State governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu who incidentally is the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, described the demise of Senator Ajimobi as a great blow to the progressives community in the country.
Senator Ajimobi who represented Oyo South in the Senate and was a two-term governor in the South West State. The Kebbi state governor in a statement he personally signed and issued to newsmen in Abuja on behalf of his colleagues in the Progressives Governors Forum said Senator Ajimobi’s death was a “loss to the nation and the Nigerian progressive community.” His statement read in part:” We received the death of His Excellency, Sen. Abiola Ajimobi with heavy heart and gratitude to Allah (SWT) for a life well blessed. “We, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), join the family, people and government of Oyo State and the nation to pray for the repose of the soul of our dear and beloved Sen. Abiola Ajimobi. His death is a loss to the nation and the Nigerian progressive community. We pray to God Almighty to grant the family the fortitude to bear this heavy loss. May Allah reward all the good work of Sen. Ajimobi, forgive his limitations and bless what he left behind. May the soul of Sen.
