Commenting on the development, the FAAN MD, Captain Yadudu had declared; “while FAAN is responding to the guidelines set by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) for gradual airport reopening and post COVID-19 operations, it is important also to compare notes with other airports in the world to make sure we are on the right track and join the global industry in building back travel confidence. “Munich airport has successfully reopened its airport and has recommenced domestic and international flights, so it is worth sharing their experience”. Also speaking on the initiative, the image maker of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu had said the FAAN intended to begin involving itself in route development and therefore, collaborative efforts between Munich and FAAN can help in that direction.
