The All Progressives Congress (APC) Appeal Committee led by Dr Abubakar Fari on Saturday night upheld the disqualification of the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki for the party primary fixed for June 22. The screening committee led by Professor Jonathan Ayuba had on Friday disqualified Governor Obaseki and two others from the race. The screening committee claimed that Governor Obaseki’s name was not properly written in his National Youth Service Corps discharged certificate and his Higher School Certificate results which it further claimed was defective. The Dr Fari appeal committee, in its report, went further to fault the University of Ibadan certificate presented by Governor Obaseki as it argued that: “It is inconceivable that the same University will award two certificates with separate dates for the same graduate. “We also find it difficult to vouch for the authenticity of his NYSC certificate, there is no indication as to where he served.” It could not be confirmed if the embattled Edo State governor made himself available to the Dr Fari appeal team as he had declared on Friday through his media aide, Crusoe Osagie that he would not appeal before it.
