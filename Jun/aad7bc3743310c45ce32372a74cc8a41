A Federal High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital has sentenced a welder, Olatunji Bangboye, to five years in prison for falsely obtaining the sum of N3.7 million from one Chinedu Okpara. Delivering judgment on Thursday, Justice Uchena Agomoh found the suspect guilty of the three count charges levelled against Bangboye and subsequently sentenced him. She said: “After listening carefully to submissions of both counsels in this hearing, there is no gainsaying that the convict is a first offender and he is remorseful. “Learned counsel to the convict has submitted that he has domestic responsibility, having four children and aged parents. This is a great responsibility and therefore wonders what happened if the convict is away for too long. “There is also evidence before this honourable court that the convict had refund the sum of N1 million through the police, out of the total contract sum; that shows he is remorseful and ready to restitute.
