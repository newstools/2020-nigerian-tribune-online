LEGAL arguments on an exparte motion seeking to restrain the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the party’s national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole from using direct primaries to elect Edo State governorship candidate of the party, have again been adjourned til Thursday, June 11. Justice M.D Umar of the Federal High Court, Benin adjourned the matter to allow the parties in the suit to be served the relevant papers‎. Joined in the suit‎ by the factional state deputy chairman of the APC, Pastor Kenneth Asemokhai and a governorship aspirant of the party, Matthew Iduoriyekemwen, is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Citing the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic and a purported resolution by the National Executive Council of the party which allegedly gave State Executive Council the nod to conduct the primary, the plaintiffs want the court to restrain the party from adopting the direct mode of primaries. Justice Umar, had earlier adjourned hearing of the motion to Monday following an argument that ensued after counsel to the defendants led by H. O. Ogbodu (SAN), appeared in court and demanded to be served the motion papers. Consequently, the presiding judge declined to grant the exparte motion, but instead gave the defendants three days to file their papers to show cause why the injunction should not be granted and adjourned the case till June 8. According to the plaintiffs, the APC constitution provides that the states should suggest the mode of primaries to the NWC, and that they have suggested indirect primaries in which 4,000 delegates would participate.
