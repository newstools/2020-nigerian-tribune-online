Lagos State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed regret over the death of the senator Senator Sikiru Bayo Osinowo representing Lagos East, describing it as “shocking loss.” The party said this in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Hon Seye Oladejo, in reaction to the death of Osinowo, who was also a four-term member of the Lagos State House of Assembly between 2003 and 2019. APC recalled that the lawmaker was in the forefront of the battle to entrench democratic governance and particularly, describing the late politician, who is popularly addressed as Peperito, as a leading light, in the struggle for the revalidation of June 12 poll, won by Chief MKO Abiola. The party also described him as a strong pillar and a stabilizing force as a long-serving member of the State House of Assembly, saying he would “be remembered for his wise counsel, matured leadership, loyalty to the party and commitment to democratic ideals.” APC, while commiserating with its National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, his immediate family and the entire Lagos State chapter of the party on the demise, prayed God for the repose of his soul, forgive his sins and grant his numerous admirers the fortitude to bear this great loss. “We commiserate with our National Leader, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, his immediate family and the entire Lagos State APC on this shocking loss. “May Almighty Allah repose his soul, forgive his sins and grant his numerous admirers the fortitude to bear this great loss,” the statement said.
