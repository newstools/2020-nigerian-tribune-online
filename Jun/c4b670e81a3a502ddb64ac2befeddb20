The total dividend translates to a dividend per share of N2.01 per share. Speaking at the AGM, on Tuesday, the Chairman of the Company, Chief Kola Jamodu, CFR disclosed that the Company had earlier paid an interim dividend of N3.99 billion, that is, 50 kobo per share, in December 2019, and that the final dividend will, therefore, be N12.1 billion, which comes to N1.51 per share which would become payable on June 24, 2020. A breakdown of the Company’s results for the period revealed that it recorded net revenue of N323 billion as against N324.4 billion recorded in 2018. Chief Jamodu explained that some of the factors that impacted on the Company’s performance in 2019 were inflation at a double-digit rate, increase in input cost and a further rise in the Excise Duty rate which could not be passed to the consumer due to continued pressure on purchasing power. The business was nevertheless able to post a positive Profit After Tax of N16 billion for the year due to a series of innovations and implementation of cost efficiencies.
