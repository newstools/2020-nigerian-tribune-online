The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has announced the relocation of its corporate head office to Abuja. The NAMA management attributed the latest development to the recent directive from the Federal Ministry of Aviation asking all agencies in the sector to relocate operational headquarters to the nation’s capital in a bid to ensure efficient and effective coordination and enhanced service delivery between the ministry and its agencies. The Managing Director of the agency, Captain Fola Akinkuotu and other critical staff of the agency had since relocated to the new NAMA headquarters located in Garki 2, Abuja, in strict adherence to the above directive while arrangements are being made for other strategic staff to follow suit in due course. The agency, therefore, admonished all enquiries and correspondence henceforth to be channeled through the Abuja address.
