Gunmen suspected to be cult members on Monday night attacked a local pub along Custom road in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, killing three persons and injuring five others that are currently in critical condition at the Federal Medical Center. Among those killed was a 50-year-old house owner, Mr Niceman Agonebi popularly known as “honourable” and another person presumed to be an in-law to the former deputy governor of the state, Hon. Peremobowei Ebibi. The owner of the pub, popularly called Madam Odey, had her jaw torn apart by a stray bullet from the rampaging cultists, while two others received fatal gunshot wounds. According to an eyewitness account, the gunmen arrived Custom road in a commercial tricycle popularly known as Keke NAPEP about 8 pm and opened fire on their target who was in the midst of people drinking at the pub. The cultists who were reportedly armed with assault rifles shot sporadically at everyone on the street. Many residents and passerby were reportedly critically injured. The arrival of the operatives of the State Police Command and some officials of the Bayelsa State Vigilante Service and State Volunteer led to a hot chase of the gunmen. They, however, escaped through the Edepie/Tombia areas of the State capital.
