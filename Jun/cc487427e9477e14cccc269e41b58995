It also resolved that states are to own and lead the implementation of the COVID-19 Community Support Centres (CSCs) where desirable. Council also noted the progress of work and support by all stakeholders and challenges encountered in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic across the states of the federation. The meeting agreed that the Federal Ministry of Health will share a Template on Needs Assessment and Daily Reporting Format on Case Management to facilitate decision making for Federal Government support to states.
