A suspected seller of guns identified as Mr. Nwoka Obiora has given details of how he used to get N5,000 commission on every gun he sold given to him by his sponsors, fabricators and others in Bayelsa State. Obiora, who had earlier stated that he was from Agudama Ekpetiama community in Yenagoa, was however recognised by a police officer as a man who escaped from jail some months ago in Yenagoa, the state capital.

Obiora, who didn’t deny the revelation from the police officer, claimed that he was into arms sales because he didn’t want to use the guns to rob. He said: “I sell guns at N20,000 each and a get commission of N5,000 on each gun I sell. I just started not quiet long and I have sold only six since I started. I don’t know the people I sell to because I am just a distributor. They are locally-made pistols and I don’t manufacture. “I am into the sale of guns business because I don’t like using the guns to rob people. I am from Agudama Ekpetiama community in Yenagoa Local Government Area. Obiora was paraded alongside 11 persons suspected to be armed robbers, while recovering 18 weapons and 20 bags of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp.
