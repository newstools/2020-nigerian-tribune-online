Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, on Monday, in Abuja, inaugurated a 16-man committee to work out modalities on how to reduce crime rate in the territory, especially in rural communities. The committee, which codenamed State Community Policing Advisory Committee (SCPAC), is to also deepen the trust between the communities and the law enforcement agencies. He said community policing throughout the world has helped in reducing crime rate by making the community and the police work together with a view to nipping the crime rate in the bud. Malam Bello said with the presidential approval granted for the implementation of community-oriented policing across Nigeria, the citizenry would soon witness a reduction in the crime rate across the country. He, therefore, appealed to the committee members to take the assignment very seriously and to give the utmost attention it deserves. According to him: “It is essential to remind them that community policing is a strategy that is anchored on trust between and the people and the security officers. Once there is a trust deficit in any guise or form, the workability of this policy becomes highly diminished and we would have lost a great opportunity in improving the security profile of the territory.” In his acceptance speech, the Committee Chairman who is also the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, promised to deliver on the mandate and to invest the requisite energy and intellect to entrench a result-oriented community policing approach that would cascade into FCT communities.
