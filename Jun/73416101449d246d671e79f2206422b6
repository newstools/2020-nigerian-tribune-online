The  Chief Operating Officer (COO) of  Ibom Air, Mr. George Ureisi has declared that within 10 months of operations that the airline had opened up the Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo and attracted more people to the state. Speaking at an Aviation webinar by Aviation RoundTable Safety Initiatives (ARTSI), Uriesi said the airport had become the fastest growing airport in Nigeria with 35% growth, adding that hotel occupancy in Akwa Ibom had gone way up with the Ibom Air coming onboard. According to him, the Akwa Ibom State Government had invested massively not only in an airport which is  “one of, if not the best airport in the country as far airport infrastructure is concerned”, but built the best Maintenance Repair and Overhaul MRO facility in the country. Though he agreed that works there were not finished, but described it as a good facility, adding that with the airline which is the third tripod on that stand, the State has been opened up for business which would result in employment creation. His words: “The airline opens up access to Akwa Ibom allows the MRO facility to be activated so that it can maintain its own aeroplanes, it brings in hugely more viability to the airport.” Ureisi who stated that 173 Akwa Ibomites were currently training to be pilots, cabin crew and customer service people while 17 young Akwa Ibom engineers are going to be certified on the CRJ900,added: “Ten years down the line imagine what that would mean for Akwa Ibom.” He stressed that it was possible for the Federal Government or State government to run an airline, if it is operated with a business model that allows it and if is efficiently and professionally run. “As a private airline whether we do it internationally I don’t know this is still an experiment and lets watch and see how this ends up. Finally, don’t think that a state owed carrier is owed forever, a state could start it set it on the right path and get out of the way, there are many options for this, it is hard for me to say yes or now.”    YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING Reps Approve $22.799bn External Loan, Revised 2020-2022 MTEF-FSP Amidst Protest
