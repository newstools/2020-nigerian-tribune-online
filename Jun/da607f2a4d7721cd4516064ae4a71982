Foremost oil giant, Shell Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) has donated a machine capable of conducting 1, 000 tests daily for COVID-19 cases to Delta State government. The company also donated an ambulance vehicle, suction machine and other critical items needed to make an isolation centre functional. Making the donation in Asaba, the state capital on Wednesday, the Managing director of SPDC and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr Osagie Okumbor, stated that Gov Ifeanyi Okowa’s administration had shown great commitment in the fight against COVID-19 in the state. According to Okumbor, who was represented by Mr Evans Krukrubo, Stakeholders Manager of the company, Delta Government deserved support from SPDC, acknowledging that the company had also received a lot of support from the government and people of the state. He stated that the government had showcased that “when you want to know what ease of doing business is, you have to come to Delta.” “The Excellency’s leadership of the state’s response to the spread of Covid-19 enables us to keep hope alive that we shall tame and overcome this challenge.
