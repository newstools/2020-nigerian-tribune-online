A Ghanaian ex-footballer based in the United Kingdom, Michael Boye Marquaye, has claimed that he is the biological father of Manchester United and England striker, Marcus Rashford. Marquaye, 65-years-old, in an interview with Starr FM Sports of Ghana says the 22-year-old England international is a Ghanaian as he is the biological father of the player. Marcus Rashford was born in Wythenshawe, Manchester in the UK with Melanie Rashford of St Kitts descent as his mother and Jamaican, Joseph Rashford as his father officially. That is, however, a record that is being challenged now by Michael Boye Marquaye, who himself was a prolific striker in his playing days in Ghana alongside the likes of Hesse Odamtten, Ben Kayode and Aboagye Dacosta of Okwahu United fame playing for several clubs in Koforidua (Eastern Region and Tema (Greater Accra Region). Marquaye, when asked why he is bringing this out now, said he simply wants to set the records straight and to let the whole world know that Marcus Rashford has Ghanaian roots and not for any other motivation.
