SEX is the most important activity in marriage. It is the only activity that cannot be successfully delegated without hiccups. Or can you delegate someone to help you have sex with your spouse? It can never happen in a normal marriage. It is therefore expected of husbands and wives to give it all serious attention for mutual maximum satisfaction of parties in each marriage. But, in reality, this ideal of mutually satisfying sex is far from being achieved by many coupled. This is due to the frustrating attitudinal behaviour of many parties in the marriage. They make sex so frustrating to the extent that sexual satisfaction is sought for outside the homes. In fact, the involvement of the hitherto unexpected or unheard of religious married spouses in such is better imagined.  What are these frustrating sex behaviours that are beclouding the sense of reasoning of many couples? Let’s read on!      Couples should therefore do all to avoid such frustrating attitudes, in order to make sex a fulfilling venture in the marriage. My book, enjoying great sex life, is still a master piece on marital sex. For details, call 08112658560.
