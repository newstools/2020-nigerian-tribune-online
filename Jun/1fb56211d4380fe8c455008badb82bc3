THE Muslim Media Practitioners of Nigeria (MMPN), Lagos chapter has launched N5million endowment fund in honour of the late Saturday Editor of the New Telegraph newspaper, Mr Waheed Bakare. The fund, the MMPN said, would help to meet the financial obligation of the education of the deceased children. The fund, which was launched last week, is expected to peak on June 12 with N5 million. The chairman of the group, Alhaji AbdulKabir Garba, said: “We are saddened by his death but we take solace in the fact that he died in the way of Allah. May Allah grant him Aljanah Firdaus. “MMPN is launching an endowment fund in his honour. The fund’s goal is to support his immediate family and help them meet the financial obligation of the education of the children. “Our target is to raise N5 million on or before June 12, 2020 which we will present to the family. “A donation in memory of a loved one is a meaningful way to immortalise that person. “We implore all our Muslim brothers to take advantage of this Sadaqah Jahriyya which will benefit both the giver and the deceased immensely. It is one of the most rewarding acts we can do during our lifetime. Its benefits can be reaped in this life and hereafter. “The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, ‘When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (a continuous charity), or knowledge from which benefit is gained, or a righteous child who prays for him.’” Garba appealed to Muslims to share in “this great reward” and be part of the initiative.
