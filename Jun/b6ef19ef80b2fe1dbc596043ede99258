The Federal Capital Territorial Administration (FCTA) on Friday described as fraud, the ongoing 2020/2021 sales of School of Nursing, Gwagwalada, forms on the internet by some fraudsters. Mrs Leo Musa, Acting Director of the Nursing Department, Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS) of the FCTA, stated this at a news conference on Friday in Abuja. According to Musa, our attention has been drawn as a department of nursing, HHSS, to the ongoing advert and sale of forms in various media on the internet. She said that reports had been coming to the department from many people about the sales of this form, stressing that the school of nursing Gwagwalada have not started the sales of any form. “We don’t have anything of such for now, we want to draw the attention of the public to this, anyone dealing with such fraudsters on the internet does so at their own risk. “As a secretariat, we have not received any approval for such, with the COVID-19 on the ground and with the rules of the Federal Government about the virus, we are not ready to go against it.
