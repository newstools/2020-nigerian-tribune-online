The Federal Government is set to constitute special committees in each state of the federation to deliberate, select and recommend persons to be engaged for the Extended Special Public Works Programme in the states. The committees, to be known as State Selection Committees, would select 1,000 persons from each of the Local Government Areas (LGA) in each state, as well as identify the projects to be executed in those areas. Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, gave the details, as he stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the programme, for selected 1000 persons each from all the 774 Local Government Areas for temporary employment during the dry season. According to the Minister, the President recently approved the extension of the Special Public Works Programme to “all 36 states and the FCT from October to December 2020 as a means of mitigating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.” He further stated that the extended programme would also be expected to “provide modest stipends for itinerant workers to undertake roads’ rehabilitation and social housing construction, urban and rural sanitation, health extension and other critical services. Hence the directive of Mr President for the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to collaborate with other Ministries with rural components in their mandates.” Keyamo recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari had previously, in October 2019, approved a pilot scheme of the Special Public Works Programme, for implementation by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) in five Local Government Areas in each of the eight pilot states of Adamawa, Borno, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Jigawa, Katsina and Kwara. According to him, the pilot scheme, an employment creation drive, which has since been concluded, was designed to “mitigate lack of job opportunity in the rural areas through short term engagement of one thousand (1000) unemployed persons per Local Government Area (LGA) for a period of three months,” with a payment of N20,000 monthly allowance to the beneficiaries. He said that the special public works, a dry season/off season transient job programme, originally designed for the rehabilitation/maintenance of public and social infrastructure, was mainly for unskilled persons resident in those rural areas.
