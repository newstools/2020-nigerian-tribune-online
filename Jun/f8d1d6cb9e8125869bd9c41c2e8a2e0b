THE Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Friday said  there was no National Day in the nation’s history that is as significant as June 12, 1993. Abiodun stated this in an address delivered on the 2020 Democracy Day in commemoration of the June 12 anniversary. He said the election was no doubt won by the late MKO Abiola, having scored 58.36 per cent of the 14 million votes cast. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for choosing June 12 to replace May 29 as Democracy Day, as the day of national rebirth. He said: “Beside the Day the Union Jack flag was lowered for the nation’s Green-White-Green flag, on October 1, 1960, there is no day with national significance like June 12, 1993.  “This is because in spite of the uniqueness and peculiarities of Nigeria, the election of MKO Abiola demystified all stereotypes about the so-called centrifugal and centripetal forces. June 12 was complete in answering to all the prerequisites which constitute an irreducible minimum for democracy. “Many Nigerians have always been of the opinion that June 12 should be a national holiday. However, only some Nigerian states were actually celebrating it until Tuesday, 6th June, 2018, when President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR surprised the whole nation by choosing June 12 to replace the hitherto May 29 as the fair, right and proper day to celebrate our National Rebirth and real day of Democracy. “The President understood the need to correct the injustice done to a proud son of Ogun State and redressed it as a pre-requisite for peace and unity is not only commendable, it is worthy of emulation. The governor said the government and people’s of the home state of the late acclaimed winner of the annulled election are proud to identify with the dreams and vision encapsulated in “HOPE 93”. He described Abiola as a selfless philanthropist, successful businessman and social democrat.
