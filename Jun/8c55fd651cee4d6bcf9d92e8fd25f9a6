Youths from the 19 Northern states under the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) stormed Katsina State on Tuesday to set the stage for a mass protest in spite of the attempts by Police to stop them. The Katsina protest, it was gathered, was the first leg of the protest as the second leg of the protest is billed to take effect from June 20, 2020, across the 18 states of the region. The CNG had earlier in a statement by its spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said it was essential to condemn the failure of both the federal and state governments in tackling the incessant killings in the region. He said the protest started in Katsina in view of the fact that the president of the country is from the state and the state is now the epicentre of banditry and cattle rustling in the country.  An eyewitness told Tribune Online that policemen barricaded the main venue of the protest at Kofar Soro as early as 7 am on Tuesday before the arrival of the youth. However, in spite of the police presence, the youth who were clad in black shirts started the protest from Kofar Durbi carrying placards with various inscriptions including “Arewa is bleeding”, “Our leaders have failed us”, “banditry and killings are our monsters, not coronavirus”, “resign if you cannot protect us”.

Police spokesman, SP Gambol Isah shedding more light on the CP’s intervention said, “the CP appreciated them for coming out even though there was no any approval letter for the protest, but he was pleased with the way and manner they protested peacefully. He warned them not to allow miscreants to use the opportunity to cause havoc.” According to him, the CP further reflected on the past insecurity issues of the nation where people can hardly go to churches or mosques freely because of bombs blast and other forms of insecurity. He added that the present security situation in the state and nation is surmountable as the government was on top of the situation, working seriously to put an end to the menace.
