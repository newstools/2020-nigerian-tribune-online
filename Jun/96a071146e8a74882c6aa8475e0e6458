The power tussle between Federal Ministry of Finance and Federal Ministry of Power over the control of Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) continued on Monday when the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed inaugurated the board of NBET with the purportedly sacked Dr Marilyn Amobi still recognised as managing director/chief executive officer. Minister of Power, Mr Saleh Mamman on Monday last week announced the appointment of Dr Nnaemeka Eweluka as a replacement for Amobi, as approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. At today’s event, Ahmed said the re-constitution of NBET board was necessitated by the challenges of the power sector, particularly the challenges of NBET in achieving its mandate. Aside Ahmed herself who is chairman of the board and Amobi, other members of the board include Suleyman Ndanusa, former Director-General of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as Non-Executive Director (Independent); Mustapha Balarabe Shehu, former President, Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE), as Non-Executive Director (Independent); and Mr Adeyeye Adepegba as Non-Executive Director (Independent). Others include a non-executive director from Ministry of Power, to be represented by staff not below the level of a director; Mr Alexander Ayoola Okoh, as non-executive director from Bureau of Public Enterprises (80% Shareholder in NBET); Ms Patience Oniha, Director-General, Debt Management Office, as non-executive director; and Mr Ben Akabueze, Director-General, Budget Office of the Federation, as Non-Executive Director. The contractual obligations and guarantees that NBET issues and manages, according to the minister, are therefore of strategic importance for the repositioning of the sector and delivering of benefits to Nigerians for which NBET was established. “The reconstitution of the board, therefore, took consideration of the current stage of evolution of the restructured electricity sector, the complexities the sector currently faces, multi-disciplinary skills of prospective Board members especially in finance and investment, electricity generation, system operations of deregulated electricity markets, administrative law, as well as economic regulation of network utilities, amongst other factors.” She urged the members to bring their skills and experiences to bear in the assignment.
