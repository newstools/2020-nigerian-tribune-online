The statement reads: “This afternoon, I presented cheques to a few of the 82 retirees who retired from the civil service in 2013. Our administration met a backlog of N26 billion in unpaid gratuities for 6,274 pensioners in the state. So far, we have cleared the backlog of arrears from the year 2012 to April 2013. “As I said during my one year in office broadcast, we have paid more in gratuities and entitlements in one year than the previous administration did in eight years. This was possible because we increased the monthly allocation for gratuities from N100 million to N180 million with effect from June 2019.”  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING MONDAY LINES: America Has Trump; We Have Buhari
