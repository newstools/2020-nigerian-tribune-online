The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has asked the federal government to bailout the aviation sector. The Executive Director, Operations at AMCON, Aminu Ismail, stated this while speaking  as one of the panelists at an aviation webinar organized by Aelex Group in collaboration with SY&T Communications Media Partners. According to him, any intervention in the aviation industry this time around must be directed at the core areas of need and should not become a jamboree, saying: “If the intervention comes in the form of grants, it must be to fund operational losses, which must be basically intended to save jobs and reimburse for operational losses induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. “It must be to promote local content – the intervention should focus on reducing dependence on foreign companies for pilot training and aircraft maintenance. For us, development of Nigerian based simulator capacity and C-Check for various Boeing aircraft types should benefit from government support. “Should the government decide that their intervention will come by way of loans, it should be in the form of low interest loans (with FX support) granted to strengthen the airlines in equipment overhaul, lease and purchase,” he proposed. While insisting that liquidity would be key factor for airline to resume operational services after COVID-19, the director said AMCON would like to see the proposed federal government intervention in the sector as quickly as possible. Suggesting that any governmental intervention now must not be used to resuscitate airlines that had stopped operations before COVID 19 broke out, Aminu added that such government intervention, must be for public good, directed at aviation companies with large labour force and who carry the most passengers in the country.
