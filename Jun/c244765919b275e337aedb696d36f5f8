His statement read in part: “It took me over six months to agree to be his surety. First, the bail condition requires a serving Senator and I happen to be the one. “Second, his health condition is deteriorating and needs special medical attention. “Third his offence is bailable and lastly I am not saying the court should discharge and acquit him.
