AN Awka-based medical practitioner, Dr. Uche Ozoekwe, has called on parents and guardians of children with albinism to show more love and attention to them, especially in seeing they are protected against skin cancer. Dr. Ozoekwe, who is also a physiotherapist and Cognitive Behaviourial Therapist, made the call in Awka recently, while discussing the theme for this year’s 2020 International Albinism Awareness Day: “Made to Shine” with journalists. Dr. Ozoekwe who noted that skin cancer or melanoma is the most popular and most dangerous disease that faces people with albinism, explained that showing love to them will help them live better with their condition, and help them avoid such things that will expose them to cancer of the skin. The medical practitioner also explained that albinism is a genetic condition that could appear in a family after many generations and advised against seeing it as an abnormality or evidence of infidelity in a woman. He went further to call against the discrimination of people living with albinism and clarified that they are normal persons who live normal lives and should not be judged by the colour of their skin. Nigerian Tribune gathered that the International Albinism Awareness Day is celebrated on June 13 annually to draw the attention of members of the public to the societal and health needs of people with albinism and also raise awareness to the 2013 resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council calling for the prevention of attacks and discrimination against persons with albinism.
