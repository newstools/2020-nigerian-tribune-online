A 15-year-old girl recently raped by an APGA chieftain in Otukpo local government area of Benue State, Eddy Ujah was said to have been defiled a few days after she survived a surgery. Recall that Eddy Ujah, a secretary of APGA party in Otukpo LGA had disappeared shortly after he raped the little girl and a bounty of N150,000.00 placed on him by a member of the House of Representatives and “One Idoma Initiative”. Barely 10 days, the party chieftain disappeared into thin air, the victim of the rape is still groaning in pains at General Hospital, Otukpo. Consequently, elders of her community, “Otada community” in Otukpo Local Government Area of the state under the aegis of Otada Elders Council, have called on the police and other security agencies to fish out the suspected rapist, Eddy Ujah. The elders in a protest letter dated June 12, 2020, addressed to the Area Commander, Otukpo Area Command and signed by the Ada’ Alekwu of Otada community, Oketa Otu, and made available to newsmen in Makurdi, condemned the alleged barbaric act of Eddy Ujah, which they noted is against the law and the gods of the land.
