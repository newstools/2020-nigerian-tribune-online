A foremost Yoruba Socio-Cultural Youth Group, Alliance Of Yoruba Youth Council Worldwide (AYYCW) was on Thursday, 25th June, endorsed by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, during a courtesy visit of the group to the Royal Father at his Palace. The monarch in his speech declared his support for the group in its quest to emancipate Yoruba race from all forms of slavery and oppression. Speaking at the occasion, the National President of the group, Dr Akande Kazeem, appreciated the Monarch for the warm reception of the group members by the monarch. He said “we appreciate Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, for finding time in his busy schedule to attend to the group. And his promise to always fight for the course of the Youth and the Yoruba Nation at large.” The National Secretary of the group, Adegunju Omotayo reiterated the monarch on the core mandate of the group, is to foster unity among Yoruba Youth and defend the right of all Yoruba men or women wherever they may be. He further emphasised on the role of youths in nation-building, he said:” for the Yoruba nation to be great again, her youths must project her positive image to the world.” The National Publicity Secretary of the group, Oladipo Gbeminiyi while introducing members of the entourage, noted that the membership strength of the group is over six million and it’s spread across the South West states including Kogi, Kwara and the FCT. The Monarch, however, charged the group to use unparallel intellectual criticism while engaging the government.
