Leading indigenous broadcasting brand, Wazobia media, Wazobia FM and Wazobia TV, has partnered with the Lagos State Government through the Lagos State Ministry of Education in providing remote learning services for students in Nigeria due to the closure of schools following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. The compulsory shutdown of schools which took place in March 2020 across all Federal and State-owned institutions was to ensure the safety of students while combating the spread of the virus. The global pandemic which spread into Nigeria led to the compulsory shut down of all schools by the Federal and State governments across the country, thereby disrupting the curricular activities of school’s in a bid to combating the spread of the deadly virus. In ensuring that students are better prepared for their upcoming examinations, especially those in the Senior Secondary School preparing for the West African Examination Council (WAEC) and National Examination Council (NECO) exams, the partnership between Wazobia Media and the Lagos State Ministry of Education is one that gives parents and students the unique opportunity to experience free seamless daily learning by top accredited tutors on dedicated programs on Wazobia Max TV channel UHF 57 from 2 pm till 4 pm and on Wazobia FM from 12 pm till 2 pm daily, Mondays to Fridays, totalling 4 hours of learning material daily. The Program has been running since Monday, March 30th and will continue throughout the school closure period. Speaking on the partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Co-Founder and CEO of Wazobia, Wazobia, Tatiana Moussalli Nouri stated that, “the educational broadcast by the Wazobia Media Brand is one driven by the commitment of the organisation in adding value through investments that are incalculable in educating students and members of the society.” ALSO READ: BREAKING: APC opts for direct primary as 14 other parties go for indirect in Edo “The daily broadcast, which commenced on the 30th of March 2020 covered various subjects such as Mathematics, English Language, Chemistry, Physics, Financial Accounting, Biology, Economics, Yoruba and Literature in English which has redefined learning for students especially during a global pandemic as this ingenious engagement has afforded millions of students across Nigeria, the opportunity to excel at their forthcoming examinations,” Tatiana added.
