Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN has disclosed that military authorities were yet to release soldiers involved in the killing of policemen who went to arrest a notorious kidnapper, Wadume in Adamawa State. In a statement late Friday by his media assistant, Umar Jubrilu Gwandu, Malami said the non-availability of the military men involved in the killing was responsible for the removal of their names on the charge sheet. “What the Office did was too severe the charges in view of the unavailability of the soldiers who in their own case need to be released by the military authorities in view of the fact that they were perhaps undergoing military processes before their release. “The interest of justice requires and legitimately allowed for segmenting the case in the interest of speedy trial.
