Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, has been commended for being at the forefront to set up a security outfit for South-South states to combat the rising crime. The commendation came from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain, Chief Sunny Onuesoke in a statement made available to Tribune Online in Warri, Delta State. It will be recalled that Senator Okowa, who is the South-South governor’s forum’s chairman on Thursday, announced that he and his colleagues who met in Asaba had agreed to establish a regional security outfit to combat crimes in the region. At the meeting were the governors of Edo, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom states. Reacting to the resolution, Onuesoke commended Okowa for leading the pack of South-South governors to initiate the move to set up a regional security outfit like Amotekun of the South West to complement the effort of the police and other security agencies in the task of policing the region and reducing crime to the barest minimum.

Describing the governor’s move as well-conceived, he pointed out that the idea was the best measure to quell the myriad of security challenges besieging the region. “Okowa’s idea of bringing  South-South governors together to set up a regional outfit is timely. “It is the right peg in the right hole. It is the best measures to get rid of insecurity challenges emanating from nefarious activities of herdsmen thriving in the absence of joint coordination of security outfit for the South-South. “The move is one of the best. This is because individual state-owned security outfits were restricted by State boundaries and made it difficult to curb inter and Intra State Crimes committed by miscreants, kidnappers, bandits and herdsmen. “The incessant crimes committed during farming seasons especially, the killing of farmer, kidnapping and rape of our women will be reduced drastically, ’’ he stated. The business mogul said that the move was a thing of joy that the South-South governors had finally aligned with the aspirations of the people of the region who had been concerned with recent incessant attacks on villagers by herdsmen and others acts of criminality.
