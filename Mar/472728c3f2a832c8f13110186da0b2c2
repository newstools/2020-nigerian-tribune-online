Veteran fuji artiste, Sefiu Alao, has attributed the circulation of songs that promote profanity and vulgarity to the lack of censorship in the Nigerian music industry. Alao, also known as baba ojo, agbara orin, stated this on Thursday at the unveiling of Saheed Ojubanire as the new media manager/publicist to Fuji Cadoso Organisation in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He decried the lack of censorship which has led to the proliferation of songs that promote vulgarity and profanity, adding that censorship will go a long way to regulate what is being projected by musicians.

We artistes are confused sometimes because when we sing well, people wouldn’t buy as expected. “Besides, there’s no censor board that regulates our music as they do for theatre practitioners. There should be regulation for the music industry too”, Alao revealed. He added that regulators should vet whatever piece is to be released as vulgar lyrics would not be allowed to air and defaulters would meet with strict punishment. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
