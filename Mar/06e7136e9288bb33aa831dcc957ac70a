Disturbed by the non-compliance to the school closure order given as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, Kano State ministry of education has inaugurated a task force that will ensure the compliance of the government’s directive in the state. Nigerian Tribune reports that the ministry lamented that most disheartening thing is that most of the identified defaulters were private schools. The commissioner of education, Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa’id Kiru said this while inaugurating the committee, tasked the Committee members to ensure the closure of any school found wanting and the prosecution of the proprietor. According to a statement signed and issued by Public Relation Officer (PRO) of the ministry, Alhaji Aliyu Yuwas, a copy made available to pressmen on Wednesday said the constitution of the committee followed series of complaints received by the ministry on the non-compliance of the directives by some unpatriotic proprietors of private schools.
