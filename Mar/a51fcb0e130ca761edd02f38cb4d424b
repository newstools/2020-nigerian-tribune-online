The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday berated All Progressives Congress (APC) senators for approving President Muhammadu Buhari’s request for a fresh $22.7 bn loan, which had been rejected by Nigerians across the board. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, the Party said in approving more financial burden on the nation, “the APC senators have further shown that their party does not have the interest of Nigerians at heart, but is only out to repress and plunge our citizens into more hardship just for their selfish gains”. The Party said it was distressing that the APC senators approved the loan, even when the Buhari Presidency has not justified the request; “a situation that validates apprehensions that the APC senators have become rubber stamp legislators”. According to the Party,” the fact that the $22.7 billion loan request brimmed with unexplained, obscure, over-bloated and questionable subheads, such as the scandalous $500 million dollars (N180 billion) smuggled in under the guise of upgrading the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), shows that the APC and a cabal in the Presidency are in a huge financial racket, for which they are ready to plunge Nigerians into more suffering.

It noted as disheartening that under the Buhari Presidency the nation’s foreign debt had continued to accumulate with nothing to show other than the excruciating unemployment rate, decayed infrastructure, a worsening governance system, escalated insecurity and unprecedented poverty. The party, however, commended the PDP senators for standing with Nigerians in fearlessly rejecting the loan as it would bring more hardship and further mortgage the future of the nation. The PDP, therefore, called on Nigerians to unite in defense of the nation by raising their voices to demand that Senate reverses this unpatriotic approval, which was completely against the national interest.
