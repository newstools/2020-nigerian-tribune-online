Last week was an expensive one for most investors, even for billionaires, the Times of India has reported The combined fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people fell by $444 billion as the coronavirus continued to spread – and spread fear – rattling equity markets worldwide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 12%, the biggest five-day slide since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, in a rout that vaporised more than $6 trillion from global stocks. The drubbing more than erased the $78 billion in gains that the 500 wealthiest people had amassed since the start of the year through last week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
