A Magistrate Court, sitting in Osogbo, Osun State capital on Friday granted an exparte motion, compelling the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi to appear before it in matter instituted against him by the Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhikirulahi Akinropo over an alleged assault. When the matter came up before the court, presided over by Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara, Oluwo was not in court and was not represented by any counsel. However, speaking during a chat with Tribune Online, counsel to Oba Akinropo, Barrister Soji Oyetayo said: “the motion that was filed in respect of leave was the order that was granted by the court today.” According to him, “we sought an order seeking leave of the court to file another application to bind him (Oluwo) over. That was the application that was heard and granted today. When we file a motion on notice, it will be fixed for hearing and by then we would respond to the motion on notice.” It is recalled that Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhikirullahi Akinropo had instituted a case of alleged assault against the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Adewale Akanbi before an Osun State Magistrate Court. He alleged that Oba Akanbi assaulted him at the office of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 11 last month, just as also sought the payment of N100 million as general damages for the assault on his person. 18 suspected cases of Coronavirus identified so far in… Coronavirus: Lagos discharges 3 suspected patients from… Tambuwal: Govt will decide on NECO fees payment next week Insecurity: Private security outfits seek arm licence ALSO READ: Bills for federal presence in Oyo North constituency scale first reading According to the writ of summons signed by his lawyer, Barrister Soji Oyetayo, which obtained by Tribune Online, Agbowu also sought the court to grant the award of N1 million against the defendants as cost of enlisting legal service.
