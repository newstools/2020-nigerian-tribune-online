POLITICIANS in the country have been advised to embrace the ideals of the sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for national development. This was the crux of an exhortation delivered by the Vicar of Our Saviour’s Anglican Church, Ikenne Remo, Venerable Samuel Enike, at the 111th posthumous birthday of Chief Awolowo, held at the family’s chapel at Obafemi Awolowo’s residence in Ikenne, Ogun State, on Friday. Enike noted that many of today’s politicians were not as selfless as Chief Awolowo in serving the people, saying a number of them were self-seeking and working to the detriment of the masses. He expressed regret that many politicians get easily carried away by the position they occupy. The cleric submitted that Chief Awolowo served the people wholeheartedly and his many legacies remain enduring. Speaking on the theme ‘Living a God-directed life’, the cleric said the nation’s politicians needed God’s direction to be able to serve the people well and for their impact to be felt across the length and breadth of the country. Enike said: “It is important for us to ask God for direction at all times. Papa Awolowo knew what to do because God gave him direction.

You must begin to understand God’s purpose for your life. “Some of our politicians, when they get to power, they turn themselves to god. They abuse the power given to them by those who elected them into power. They are always overwhelmed by the positions they occupy temporarily, while people under them groan. “Awo, during his time, served the people. How I wish our politicians and others learn from his good deeds.” While thanking guests present at the service, the chairman of the African Newspapers of Nigeria (ANN) Plc, Reverend (Mrs) Omotola Oyediran, noted that her father’s name had continued to resonate in Nigeria and beyond. She said: “We thank God for Papa’s life. We are very proud of him as a family because his name and deeds are being talked about almost every day. He will live forever in our hearts.” A Bible reading from Ecclesiastical Chapter 11 was taken by Co-chairman, ANN Plc, Ambassador (Dr) Olatokunbo Awolowo Dosumu. Among dignitaries present at the service were the Alakenne of Ikenne, Oba Adeyinka Onakade; Reverend Olusesan Adebajo and several others. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
