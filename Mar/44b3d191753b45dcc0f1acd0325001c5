He stated that non-interest income grew by 64 per cent, mainly driven by trading income. Mr Adegbohungbe noted that the bank took advantage of the market volatility and increased market penetration in fixed income trading in the year. He said the bank fully divested from its subsidiaries, returning its focus to its core strength of banking. According to him, this divestment is expected to free up additional capital and increase shareholders’ value. He said operating expense declined moderately due to effective cost saving initiatives implemented by the organisation. “The bank was able to curtail the Year on Year operating expense which dipped by one per cent despite prevalent double-digit inflation. “The bank’s risk assets recorded an increase of 34 per cent, mainly attributable to the need to aggressively cover the earning asset gap in the face of declining yields and to ensure continued compliance with regulatory measures to improve lending,” he added.
