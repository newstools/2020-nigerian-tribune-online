There are speculations that President Muhammadu Buhari has removed Dr Dakuku Peterside as Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and appointed the agency’s former Executive Director of Finance and Administration, Dr Bashir Jamoh as the new Director-General of NIMASA. Disclosing this to the Tribune Online exclusively, a source at the Federal Ministry of Transportation (FMOT) stated that the change is a Presidential order. According to the source: “Mr President will also name a new management for NIMASA in the coming days. The decision to relieve Dakuku Peterside as DG of NIMASA is very disappointing because he has achieved a lot as NIMASA DG.
