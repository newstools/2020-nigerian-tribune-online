As she was on her way home from the farm, her armed and tipsy husband accosted her and demanded the whereabouts of the children. “The deceased was not responding to the abuse being rained on her. Her police husband cocked his rifle and shot her in the leg. Other sympathizers attempted to grab him from behind and possibly disarm him but he turned the firearm towards them and threatened to kill anybody that tries to stop him. “After warding of bystanders with the riffle, he then shot her in the stomach. Thereafter he made a phone call, saying ‘I have shot her and I have dealt with her’ and then walked away as everybody watched.” When contacted, the spokesperson of the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the development, saying that the killer Police Inspector has been arrested and under investigation.
