The Federal Government has signed a new partnership deal with Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), on Wednesday, for the lease of one hectare of land in Bayelsa State. The lease agreement was signed by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) on behalf of the Federal Government for the development of a Pressure Reduction and Metering Station by Shell. The Pressure Reduction and Metering Station will be used to distribute part of the gas from Shell’s Gbarain-Ubie Gas Plant for domestic utilisation. The land property covering one hectare belongs to the NCDMB which said it has been positioned to be a catalyst for industrialisation of the Nigerian oil and gas industry.
