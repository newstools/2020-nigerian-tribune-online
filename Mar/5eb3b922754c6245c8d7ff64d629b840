The Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, on Tuesday, confirmed the fourth case of COVID-19 in the state. Coker, flanked by the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun, on Public Communications, Hon. Remmy Hazzan, said the new case was a contact to the 62- year-old male who returned from the United Kingdom, on March 7th. The new contact, a 30-year-old lady was said to have contracted the disease from the third contact, who incidentally was her father. She said: “Last night, we confirmed a positive case of COVID-19. She is a 30-year-old female, a contact of the third case. We ran 68 tests, of which we had four positives. “The four positives are actually two clusters. The second case was a contact of the first and the fourth case is the contact of the third. “As I said, we ran 68 tests, four positives and we have 58 negatives and six are pending. We also have contact traced 112 individuals of which 40 have completed their 14-day follow up. We are currently actively following up 72 cases.” The commissioner informed that a male individual, who presented himself at the General Hospital, Ijaye, with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, was isolated and tested negative of the disease. “We like to address some issues. Firstly, the individual that presented to Ijaiye Hospital, with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, since then, the individual who is a male has been admitted into the isolation centre and tested negative of COVID-19. We’ve treated him for other ailments and he has today been discharged home hale and hearty,” she added.
