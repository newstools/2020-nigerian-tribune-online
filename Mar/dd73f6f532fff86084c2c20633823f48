The Kano State government has approved the appointment of Alhaji Nasiru Ado Bayero as the new Emir of Bichi. The appointment follows the appointment of his brother, the former Emir of the Emirate as the new Emir of Kano. Recall that the state government earlier approved the dethronement and removal of former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Mohammadu Sanusi II, as Emir of Kano on Monday. Though there was no official confirmation from the state government as at the time of filing this report, insider reports indicate that the former Emir of Kano, Alhaji Sanusi, has been banished to Nasarawa State.
