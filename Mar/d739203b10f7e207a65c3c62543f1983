The House of Representatives on Friday was shocked at hearing that two rectors ran the activities of the Federal Polytechnic, Ekowe, Bayelsa State, and consequently the institution could not produce audited accounts to the office of the Auditor-General of the federation for years. The Acting Bursar of the institution, Mr Otobo Steve, revealed this at the ongoing investigative hearing of the House Committee of Public Accounts, that it was infighting between the two former heads of the institution that delayed the auditing of its accounts for over four years. He said that one of the contenders was dead while one is still alive and that the incumbent was away abroad attending a 2-week workshop being sponsored by the institution. Worried by this development, the committee summoned the Minister for Education Mallam Adamu Adamu and the Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Dr Mas’udu Adams Kazaure and resolved to formally inform the President, Muhammadu Buhari over the activities of the Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs, of Government.
