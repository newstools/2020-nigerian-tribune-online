Hundreds of members of the Action Alliance (AA) from the northern senatorial district, including the party’s candidate on the platform of the party, during the 2019 general elections, Dr Tunji Abayomi on Sunday led other political leaders from the area to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Some of the defectors who returned to the APC from AA included the candidates in Akoko North-East/Akoko North-West federal constituency, Hon. Friday Olemija in Akoko South West/Akoko South East federal constituency, Dr Segun Ategbole, Idanre/Ifedore federal constituency and Hon. Sunday Akinwalere among others. While receiving the returnees, the governor of the State, Mr Rotimi, APC National Vice Chairman (South West) Pastor Bankole Oluwajana and APC State Chairman, Engr, Ade Adetimehin, said the new members will add to value to the party. It will be recalled that Abayomi and others left APC for AA in the run-up to the last general elections after they were wrongfully denied from participating in the party’s primary elections.
