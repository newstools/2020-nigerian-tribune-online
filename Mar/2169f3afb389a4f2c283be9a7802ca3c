Internal reserves and borrowing in local markets will be insufficient to cover these needs, so substantial funding from the IMF, other institutions and bilateral creditors will be. “It is clear” that the world has “entered a recession as bad or worse” than the global financial crisis in 2009. The coronavirus pandemic will cause global economic output to contract in 2020. “There may be a sizable rebound, but only if we succeed at containing the virus everywhere,” said the IMF chief.
