The presidency on Thursday dismissed as falsehood the claim in an audio message alleging that President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of State to the president, Mallam Abba, have been secretly flown out of the country for treatment abroad. In the message, a lady could be heard narrating how the supposed trip was arranged, claiming that she learned about it from her friend whose husband is an Air Force pilot earlier contacted to fly the duo. When asked to respond to the claim, the Special Adviser to the president on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, said he would not comment on falsehood.

Simple. Their minds are diseased and incapable of clean and edifying thoughts. President Buhari is on top of ensuring that Nigerians are kept safe from Covid-19.
