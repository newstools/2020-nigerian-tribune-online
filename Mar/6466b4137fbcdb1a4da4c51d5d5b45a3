In view of the current new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the management of KolaDaisi University, Ibadan (KDU-I), on Monday gathered students and staff to educate them on how to improve and maintain their health and prevent infection. In his opening remarks, the vice-chancellor, Professor Luke Kolade Ayorinde, noted that the health talk would be in series, which would help students and staff to learn skills that would be useful for them in making healthy choices throughout their lifetime. Director of Health Services, KDU-I, Dr Jerry Ayejumon, while delivering the health talk, told the participants that “most people who become infected may experience only mild illness and recover easily, but it can be more severe in others, particularly the elderly and persons with other underlying chronic illnesses.” ALSO READ: I have filed for stay of execution ― Oshiomhole Britain confirms first coronavirus death Factbox: Countries evacuating nationals from coronavirus-hit… Italian coronavirus deaths jump to 148, cases climb to 3,858 South Africa confirms first case of coronavirus Ayejumon charged the students and staff to take good care of their health and maintain hand and respiratory hygiene to protect themselves and others, such as regularly and thoroughly washing their hands with soap and water, and using alcohol-based hand sanitizer; maintain at least one and a half metres (five feet) distance between them and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. He advised persons with a persistent cough or sneezing to stay at home or not mix in a crowd. “Make sure you and people around you follow good respiratory hygiene; meaning, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or cough or sneeze into your sleeve at the bent elbow. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. “Stay home if you feel unwell with symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19 through official channels on TV and radio, including the Federal Ministry of Health,” Ayejumon said. He also advised them to call the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control toll-free number- 0800-970000-10, which he noted is always available day and night, for guidance. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
