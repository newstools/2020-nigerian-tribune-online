They have done very well. What even makes their stories more interesting is their never-say-die sales and marketing habits. “They are customers that wouldn’t take no for an answer. Besides, some of them despite operating in the Northern part of the country, remain undaunted by the challenge posed by insurgency and banditry in the area,” she added. While commending the trade partners on their exploits in 2019, the Guest Speaker, Dr Segun Alabi, stressed the need for them and the management of the company, to sustain the symbiotic relationship presently existing between them. This, he added, would go a long way in ensuring better working relationship and positively impacting the bottom-lines of both the distributors and the company. While commending the company for deeming it fit to, again, honour its distributors, Mr Lukman Adams, who emerged the company’s Best Distributor Overall, noted that such recognition would further spur the distributors, to do more.
