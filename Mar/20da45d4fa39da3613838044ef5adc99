Dethroned Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi, has arrived Loko, a town in Nasarawa State, to which he was banished, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports. A NAN correspondent reports that the dethroned monarch arrived his new abode around 3 a.m. Tuesday morning. Alhaji Abubakar Ahmed Sabo, the traditional ruler of Loko, who confirmed the development, said that Sanusi arrived his palace “around 3 a.m. on March 10″. The first-class traditional ruler, however, said that the press would not be allowed to interview the dethroned emir.
