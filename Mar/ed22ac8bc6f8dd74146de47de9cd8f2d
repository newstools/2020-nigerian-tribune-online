The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says prospective candidates for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) are free to print their examination slips for the Computer Based Test. The board’s UTME is scheduled to commence nationwide on Saturday, March 14. The Head, Media, and Information of the board, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Lagos that the examination slips could be printed anywhere. According to him, candidates are expected to look out for the locations of their centers before their examination dates. “This is in order to avoid running around on the examination day trying to locate the centers, and as a result, getting to the center late. “It should be stated clearly now that lateness to the examination will not be tolerated, no matter the excuse,” he said. Benjamin said that come 2021, the board’s portal would be integrated into that of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).

Benjamin assured the board’s commitment in improving the examination process. “The board will not relent in its effort, in ensuring that its processes are devoid of corrupt practices,” he assured.
