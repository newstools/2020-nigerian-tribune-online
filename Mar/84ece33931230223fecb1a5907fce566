Our Personal & Business Banking division contributed to profit yet again with a significant improvement in profit after tax year-on-year. Cost of risk was 0.2 per cent compared to the writeback in the prior year due to a nonoccurrence of a significant recovery, however, it is still well below our guidance of 3 per cent. Our sustained focus on cost containment coupled with revenue growth during the year yielded an improvement in the cost-to-income ratio of 50.4 per cent from 52.9” per cent in 2018.” While acknowledging that the regulatory and economic environment could sometimes be challenging, he stated that the company remained resolute in its target to emerge as Nigeria’s leading end-to-end financial solutions provider. He stated: “While we look to 2020 with great optimism, we are fully aware of the challenging macro-economic and regulatory headwinds that we must contend with as we enter a new decade. Nonetheless, our strategic journey towards becoming the leading end-to-end financial solutions provider by 2023 continues as we leverage our universal capabilities whilst focusing on cost management, digitisation and client centricity in accelerating growth in 2020.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
