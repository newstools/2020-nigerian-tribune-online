The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has re-arraigned Uyiekpen Giwa-Osagie, lawyer to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, for allegedly laundering $2m during the 2019 general elections. It would be recalled that Atiku contested in the elections against the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). In the three counts filed before the Federal High Court in Lagos, the EFCC accused Atiku’s lawyer and his younger brother, Erhunse Giwa-Osagie, of conspiring to make a cash payment of $2m without going through a financial institution during the election.

Aneke. They had earlier been arraigned August last year before Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the same court. Their re-arraignment on Friday followed the transfer of the case file from Justice Oweibo to Justice Aneke. Following an application by their lawyer, Ahmed Raji (SAN), Justice Aneke permitted them to continue on the bail earlier granted them by Justice Oweibo. The judge later adjourned till Monday, March 9, to rule on Atiku’s lawyer’s application seeking permission to travel to London for a medical appointment. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
