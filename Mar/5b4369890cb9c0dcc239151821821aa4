Chairman of Oyo State Housing Corporation, Chief Bayo Lawal, on Monday, said coronavirus (COVID-19) currently threatening the existence of humanity globally, including Nigerians, is real. Chief Lawal made the disclosure while addressing staff of the corporation on safety consciousness of the rampaging virus which on Monday claimed the life of the 67-year-old  former managing director of Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Suleiman Achimugu. Lawal, therefore, advised staff of the corporation to be cautious of whom they relate and have contact with, saying they should ensure all relatives on visits from the United Kingdom, United States or other overseas countries observe self-isolation for some days. The Housing Corporation chairman also admonished them to comply with safety precautions against the spread of the virus by sanitising at the entrance to the reception of the corporation before and after leaving their offices after official duties. He assured workers of the corporation that the Oyo State government is on top of the situation, but warned that nobody should trivialise the reports about the virus. It will be recalled that NCDC on Monday confirmed that 36 people in different parts of the country had contracted COVID-19.
