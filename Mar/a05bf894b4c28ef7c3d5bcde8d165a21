The Vice-chancellor, UI, Professor Idowu Olayinka, in an interview with journalists, said, “We are not leaving anything to chance in the university. We are optimistic that nothing bad will happen here, so, we shall take the necessary precautions. People have to use hand sanitizers and wash their hands at every given opportunity. People should also avoid hugging now or shaking hands.” Prof Olayinka declared that Jaja, the UI clinic, was well prepared to handle in the event of the virus. According to him, “People in Jaja are experts; I think they are aware of public health issues.

No cause for alarm as far as we can say; we are optimistic that all would be well.” The Coordinator, Workplace Wellness Programme, UI, Dr Oluwasanu Olabayo, said the first step taken towards addressing the challenge of the virus in the university was to create awareness. Olabayo said: “The first thing is to address the panic being generated and we are trying to douse the tension so that people will not go about spreading the rumour of what does not exist. “We are aware that there are a few suspected cases in the country. We are doing what we have to do such as hand washing just like in the day of Ebola. We are creating awareness on personal hygiene and educating people about its symptoms and its mode of spread.” According to him, Jaja Clinic has a transit isolation den where a suspect could be kept before referrals. “If we have a high index of suspicions; in any case, we would immediately notify and then we can transfer. We cannot keep suspected cases for so long because of the panic such can generate.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
