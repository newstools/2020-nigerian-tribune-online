KANO State government, in its effort to take preventive measures and  to avert the spread of Coronavirus, has commenced screening of visitors, most especially VIPs, coming to the state government house . This was just as the state government is  ensuring that people are adequately  screened at other strategic places to  check the spread of Coronavirus in the state. Making the assertion on Friday  after the screening exercise at Government House, deputy governor, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, said the exercise was part of strategic measures put in place by the federal and state governments in detecting people with the virus. “By taking these measures at the Government House, we will make sure that all those who think they are the VIP’s are screened. Whoever has to come to the govt house must be screened. Gawuna maintained that the  coronavirus did not emanate in Nigeria but from other foreign countries, stressing that the people that have access to Nigeria are the so called VIPs who normally visit for official reasons. He said “so if it is the case of specifications, VIPs are the ones  to be screened first.” PDP set to cut staff strength by 50% Nigeria cannot survive without fundamental restructuring ―… Coronavirus: Lagos discharges 3 suspected patients from… No price too much to pay for security in Nigeria  —Ex AGF,… On other, measures taken by the state to control the prevalence of the COVID-19, Dr. Nasiru explained that the state had already reinforced its rapid response teams everywhere and was embarking on people sensitisation programmes.
