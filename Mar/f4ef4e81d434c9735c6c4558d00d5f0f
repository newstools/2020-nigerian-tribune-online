The president of the African Church Grammar School Ilesa Old Students Association, Olugbenga Onigbogi, has appealed to the Osun State government to return missionary schools in the state to their original owners. He attributed lack of discipline in public schools to moral decadence in the society and failure of relevant stakeholders, including parents and government, to instill values in pupils in public schools. Onigbogi made the remarks during the 55th Founder’s Day anniversary of African Church Grammar School, Ilesa. “The return of missionary schools to their original owners will go a long way to ensure restoration of qualitative education and effective management of these schools. “Some states in the South-East and even Lagos State have returned missionary schools to their owners. Osun can also follow the same path. “We are pleased to note, with gratitude, the steps being taken by the state government to restore the 6-3-3-4 system of education. Once this is achieved and our school is restored as a high or grammar school, we shall provide the necessary support that will enable the students to excel and thus restore the old glory of the school,” Onigbogi remarked. He listed the aims and objectives of the association to include the maintenance of cordial relations and mutual respect amongst members irrespective of age, creed, colour or religion. Onigbogi added: “We are also committed to the development of the school and to organise fundraising activities for this purpose. “All the class sets have jointly and severally made financial contributions towards provision of amenities, infrastructure and facilities for the school.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
