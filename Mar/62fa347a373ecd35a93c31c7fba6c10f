A Nigerian man who returned from France has been quarantined in Lagos State over coronavirus after he developed a headache and respiratory symptoms. Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, made the disclosure on Thursday while giving an update on coronavirus in the country. According to him, the Nigerian, who had been isolated in Yaba, travelled to France seven days ago and just returned to Lagos three days ago, saying the man developed a severe headache and respiratory symptom at a private hospital and was referred to the government for advice. The commissioner said the state government decided to isolate him because he had a history of travelling to France, one of the coronavirus hit countries.
