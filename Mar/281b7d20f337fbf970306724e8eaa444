South Africa’s health minister on Thursday confirmed the nation’s first case of the novel coronavirus, in a 38-year-old man who had recently travelled to Italy. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the patient, from the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, had travelled to Italy with his wife. They were, he said in a statement, part of a group of 10 people who returned to South Africa on March 1. “The patient consulted a private general practitioner on March 3, with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a cough,” the minister said. “The practice nurse took swabs and delivered it to the lab. The patient has been self-isolating since March 3. The couple also has two children. The Emergency Operating Center has identified the contacts by interviewing the patient and doctor. The tracer team has been deployed to KwaZulu-Natal with epidemiologists and clinicians from NICD. The doctor has been self-isolated as well.” ALSO READ: Warren to end 2020 Democratic White House bid 290 million students out of school as global virus battle… Coronavirus: NCAA orders foreign airlines to issue health… Millions of barrels of unsold West African oil are piling Up Coronavirus: Lagos govt in search of 35 passengers of… The World Health Organization said more than 93,000 people have been infected worldwide since the beginning of the outbreak in late 2019.
