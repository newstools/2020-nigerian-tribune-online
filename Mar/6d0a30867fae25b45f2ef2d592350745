THE Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, (MWUN), has warned against unrest in the sector; as it alleged a plan by some group of people to create unrest and crisis. MWUN also hinted of an attempt by those it tagged ‘some unscrupulous persons and groups’ to malign and smear the leadership of the MWUN and destabilise the union. The union was reacting to a trending report in the social media by a group called Save Climate and Democracy Naija, linking the union and its leadership to the murder of a member of the union and a six months old baby during an attack on the union’s secretariat by armed thugs in 2001. MWUN therefore, called on security agents to investigate this issue; fish out and deal with those behind the group in accordance with the law before its activities breach the industrial peace and security in the ports.

The union explained that Nigeria Police and not MWUN instituted a court case against Fagnon; adding that there have been several alleged failed attempts by the said Fagnon to create crisis the union between 2012 and 2016, which culminated into his arrest along sides other suspected persons at the union’s national secretariat on May 31, 2016.
