Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has called on Nigerians to heed the warnings from two former leaders namely General Yakubu Gowon and Chief Olusegun Obasanjo that the country must restructure to avoid a war situation in the face of numerous challenges, saying that only those who do not wish the county well would ignore such statesmanly call. SMBLF made this call on Sunday in a joint statement by Yinka Odumakin for the South West, Gen C.R.U Ikekire (South East), Senator Bassey Henshaw (South-South) and Dr Isuwa Dogo (Middle Belt), just as it affirmed that the warnings to Nigerians from the two oldest ex-leaders in two months to restructure the country and avoid a war situation was not lost on the group. The group, while aligning itself with the warnings by the two leaders, said the concern they raised was the core issue at the heart of restructuring calls, pointing out that the citizens can live together in peace and harmony once the country made justice and equity the cornerstones of its existence ”and not a union of the horse and the rider that is the order at this time in violation of federal spirit.” ALSO READ: Foundation provides free medical services to 500 women, children in Kaduna Again, Senate vows to pass Petroleum Industry Bill Foundation provides free medical services to 500 women,… Schools in Lagos move against spread of coronavirus Coronavirus: FCT residents decry scarcity of face masks According to SMBLF, “It is sheer wishful thinking for anybody to assume that the displeasure that various nationalities are feeling over the many attendant inequities of unitary Nigeria can disappear with strong-arm tactics and bullying those at receiving ends with terror gangs on a rampage around the country.” Going memory lane, the group said events around the world in recent years had shown clearly that the force of arms cannot succeed in keeping together any diverse people brought together by historical circumstance but refused to constitute themselves with respect, justice and understanding. SMBLF, therefore, called on those in the saddle now to look beyond what it described as temporary gains of power and heed the advice to set the country, Nigeria on the path of negotiation, inclusiveness and a federal constitutional order, warning that a stitch in time as contained in ancient wisdom saves nine. ”A cursory look at events around the world in recent years have shown clearly that the force of arms cannot succeed in keeping together any diverse people brought together by historical circumstance but refuse to constitute themselves with respect, justice and understanding,” the group recalled. ”We align with the patriotic interventions of the Leaders and call on those in the saddle now to look beyond temporary gains of power and heed the advice to set this country on the path of negotiation, inclusiveness and a federal constitutional order. A stitch in time saves nine says ancient wisdom,” it warned. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
