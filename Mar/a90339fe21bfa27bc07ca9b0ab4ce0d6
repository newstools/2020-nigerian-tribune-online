Unity Bank Plc has launched an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, USSD banking in Nigeria’s three major languages – Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo. This makes Unity Bank the first Nigerian commercial bank to offer USSD in a local language. USSD transactions have gained traction over the past five years among bank customers, compelling Nigerian financial institutions to make it a core component of their e-payment solutions. According to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, NIBBS USSD transactions grew by 35 per cent in 2018 to N261 million from 25 per cent in 2017. The introduction of Nigerian languages is an added feature to the Unity Bank’s USSD Platform and by dialling the Short Code: *7799# on any mobile phones, Unity Bank’s customers will now have the option to continue their transactions in any of their preferred languages.
