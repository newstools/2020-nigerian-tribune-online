The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has cautioned chieftains of opposition parties to refrain from partisan comments that could frustrate genuine efforts to combat the deadly global scourge, Coronavirus. The party in a statement, signed by its national publicity secretary, Mallam Lanre Isa-Onilu, said all hands must be on deck to curtail deadly virus. The APC commended what it called “the proactive work and coordination being carried out by the Federal Ministry of Health, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Lagos and Ogun State governments along with other health institutions, personnel and states.” It noted that “the feat of discovering the country’s first case within 24 hours and result of test within 4 hours is pointer to the capacity of this government to manage and deal with the outbreak, a feat recognised and commended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at a news conference for an update on the global outbreak.” ALSO READ: Coronavirus: Cross River govt distributes 5,200 protective equipment to airport, borders Coronavirus: World’s richest lose $444 billion after… Coronavirus: Sanwo-Olu allays fears Reps probe illegal extortion of truck drivers by Police,… Court grants Iyanya N20m bail over alleged car theft The statement further read in part: “In managing outbreaks such as the coronavirus, transparent and effective communication is key and this government has demonstrated this in no uncertain way through delivery of up-to-date and timely information on developments, measures being taken and progress made. “In observation of world standard protocol on prevention and cure of coronavirus, screening and surveillance measures at the airports, seaports and designated entry points are in place. Medical facilities to deal with any eventuality are also in place and in top gear. We call on all citizens to stay alert but confident. “This is a time when real patriots put in their own positive shifts in conjunction with the government. It is not a time to spread fear and rumour. We call on all Nigerians to ignore people seeking to create panic through fake news. We all should rely only on the official sources of information on the coronavirus “We have observed with disgust the utterances of some partisans following the report of the country’s first case of coronavirus. It is irresponsible of any political party to seek political gains from an issue that bothers on the health and well-being of all of us. “Among other treatment successes being recorded in cases of coronavirus, China has shared its treatment procedure of coronavirus with Nigeria as disclosed by the health minister, Dr Osagie Ehanire. Our handling of the Ebola outbreak was exemplary. We call on all Nigerians to remain upbeat and confident that this too will be another good outing for us.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
