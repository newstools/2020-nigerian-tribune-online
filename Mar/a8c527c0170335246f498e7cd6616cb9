Afro Hip-hop singer, Adeshile Oniwonlu, professionally known as Shyboss in the music industry has revealed the sacrifices he made, in trying to pursue his dream of being a singer. In a recent interview with Tribune Online, the “Kilode” crooner said he had issues trying to make it on his own as well as issues with choosing between music and his primary profession, building construction. Hear him: “Talking about sacrifices I have made so far, in music, I will say it’s coming out on my own, trying to focus on the music as much as I can. The industry is very hard, so you have to push yourself. At one time I was with Olu Maintain, I tried to launch out under his umbrella but it wasn’t easy for us. We also tried to meet with P-Square at a time to work something out but it never worked out. Then I talked to my friend and we opened our own studio and we tried to produce as much as I could.” He added further that he worked with Orezi, Kiddominant at some point in his career.

He bagged the Masters degree at University of Sharjah, Dubai, United Arabs Emirates, Influenced by defunct Mo’hits crew, particularly, Don Jazzy and D’Banj but much earlier in his musical journey, it was Eedris Abdulkareem and Ruggedman who caught his fancy the more. When just fresh out of secondary school, he, his brother, and a couple of friends formed a music group called “Boys For Love” and their most memorable moment was when they could get Ruggedman to grace their carnival.
