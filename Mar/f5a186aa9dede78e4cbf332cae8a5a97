According to sources, the attacks were reprisal attacks against the villagers who they accused of providing information to security agencies which resulted in their mass killing. It will be recalled, the attacks were carried out when the military is still carrying out offensive attacks on camps occupied by the bandits inside the thick forests within Giwa, Birnin Gwari and Igabi local government areas.
