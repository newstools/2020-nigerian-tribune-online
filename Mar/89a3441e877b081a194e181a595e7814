Adewale, who was the Lagos West Senatorial candidate in the 2015 election and later became the state chairman of PDP in Lagos, gave this commendation on Wednesday as he along other leaders and members graced the party’s rally held at Mapo Hall, Ibadan Oyo State capital on Wednesday. The rally was put together by the regional leaders of the party, which was aimed at bringing back all its top members who left the party and also to consolidate on its internal peace.
