This is, in part, assessed to be due to the increased risks facing perpetrators within the Nigerian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as a result of enhanced security coordination and the increasingly prevalent use of Security Escort Vessels. “This is combined with an effective lack of coordinated security measures beyond the Nigerian EEZ has led to perpetrators to travel further in search of high yield targets.” The Gulf of Guinea is the north-easternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean from Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Palmas in Liberia. The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf.
