Last time we began looking at the use and abuse of machines and technology. People have varied opinions about this issue. Just as there is always two sides to any coin so there has been the argument about the pros and cons of the use of  machines. Some believe technology is gradually taking the place of human beings. They argue it is making human beings redundant thereby increasing unemployment. Technology, some say, is creating a people who don’t have personal face to face interactions and who are projecting false images about themselves or engaging in outright deceit. “My generation was secretive, brooding, ambitious, showoffy, and this generation is congenial. Totally. I imagine them walking around with GPS chips that notify them when a friend is in the vicinity, and their GPSes guide them to each other in clipped electronic lady voices and they sit down side by side in a coffee shop and text-message each other while checking their e-mail and hopping and skipping around Facebook to see who has posted pictures of their weekend.” Garrison Keillor There are people who  are outrightly against technology even though technology is a reality we have to accept, embrace and maximize if we are to function effectively in life. “Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.”   J.K. Rowling Much as technology has its drawbacks we cannot throw away the baby and the bath water. The truth of the matter is that we cannot do without technology. “Can you avoid knowledge? You cannot! Can you avoid technology? You cannot! Things are going to go ahead in spite of ethics, in spite of your personal beliefs, in spite of everything.” Jose M. R. Delgado Technology is making life easier, faster and more efficient. We need technology to make us achieve more and have greater impact with the things we are involved with. If our lives will count we must have a balanced approach to the use of machines and technology. Rapping in gospel music is not a sin —Mercy Lent: Its significance, impact by clerics North needs a Bakin Zuwo like yesterday (1) Now that coronavirus is here Technology is neutral. It can be used in positive and negative ways. It’s all about our values.” Keith Instone With the way technology is advancing we need, more than ever before, to evaluate what we are doing not only to make ourselves technology compliant but also to ensure we do not become obsolete and irrelevant.  If we do not update and improve ourselves we stand the risk of being replaced by a machine. This has been the case of some people. We have seen many people replaced by robots. We must develop our competence to the level where we are irreplaceable. We must transition from just being contributors to being irreplaceable institutions. “One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men.  No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.” Elbert Hubbard We must be a people of uncommon and irreplaceable competence else in a few years time we become totally irrelevant in life. We must live in such a way that technology enhances and does not replace our competence. CONCLUDED FOR ENQUIRIES/ COMMENTS PLEASE SEND EMAIL TO charismokola@yahoo.com SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
