The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, has decried the high cost of rice in Nigeria, describing the price as unpatriotic. This is just as the Minister lauded the effort of farmers in Nigeria, stating that it will help actualise the government’s agenda in the Agricultural sector being food sufficiency, job creation and economic growth. The Minister said this during a working visit to rice farms and mills of Stallion Group Limited, Popular Farms and Mill Limited – the producers of Stallion rice in Kano, Kano State during the weekend. He said: “I see no reason why a 50kg bag of rice should be sold for N17,000, the same paddy rice is sold at N8,500 and maximum processing expense is N2,000 making a total of N10,500, it is unpatriotic to sell a bag more than N14,000 to N15000.” ALSO READ: Coronavirus: Nigerian stock market hits 7 months low Furthermore, Nanono noted that the Nation’s land border closure had resulted in an accelerated and increased output by rice milling plants in Nigeria, adding the boost would reduce the high rate of unemployment.
