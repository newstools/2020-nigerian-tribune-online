According to the statement signed by the state publicity secretary of the party, Mr John Akans, the party called on the APC-led administration in the state to value the lives of Plateau citizens by taking serious and comprehensive measures to safeguard the lives of innocent people entrusted with the government. “But to our dismay since the outbreak of this deadly virus which has ravaged the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO, the Plateau State government has not made public any statement on measures being taken by the government to provide facilities to avert, test nor handle this pandemic in case of any outbreak in the state like other concerned states have done.
