After the training, they just went to sleep. I want to believe that your case will not be like that because it will amount to waste of resources and time.” While commending the state governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, for prompt payment of funds for rural communities through the world bank, the General Manager appealed to the governor to do more to enable other communities to benefit from the projects. Speaking on behalf of other trainees , Mallam Umar Abdulrahman, from Oruvecheba community in Okene local government area, said that the training would enable them gain knowledge on project execution and management. He commended the agency for their effort in ensuring that the living standard of the people living in the rural areas improve through the provision of projects that have a direct impact on the lives of the people.
