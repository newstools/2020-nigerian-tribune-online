President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday felicitated with former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on his 68th birthday. A statement issued in Abuja by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media & Publicity), said the President joined Nigerians and the APC in celebrating the former Lagos State governor. President Buhari saluted Tinubu’s “courage, forthrightness and diligence in providing exemplary and broadminded leadership for the political party, extolling him for particularly taking the path of wisdom in solving problems.” The President expressed the belief the Tinubu “has inspired great leadership in Lagos, which is the commercial nerve centre of the country, and extended his large-heartedness to other states and the legislature, steadily providing a ladder for budding leaders to grow and contribute to national development.” President Buhari affirmed that Tinubu’s greatest strength lay in his “ability to look beyond religious, ethnic and political stereotyping, embracing the reality of Nigeria as one entity, and extending his warmth, acumen and experience to other parts of the country, particularly in difficult times like the current struggle against COVID-19.” The President prayed that Almighty God will grant the APC chieftain longer life, strength and good health.
