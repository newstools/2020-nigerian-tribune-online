The narrative of the African woman is one of strength, determination and creativity, and we’re proud to continue to support and celebrate all women who have, and continue to achieve so much by utilising the power of their voices through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.” Platforms like Facebook continue to be an important tool for women business leaders worldwide.
