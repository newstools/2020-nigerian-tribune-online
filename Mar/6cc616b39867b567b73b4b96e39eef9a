The executive committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara state has said that, contrary to insinuation by some aggrieved members of the party in the state, there is no crisis within the party. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin on Monday, the state APC chairman, Alhaji Bashir Bolarinwa, said that there is a disconnect between the present APC administration in the state and the party and between the administration and elders of the party in the state. It is recalled that some aggrieved executive members of the party, led by APC deputy chairman, Abdullahi Samari, had last weekend, accused the party chairman of high-handedness. Represented by APC Vice Chairman, Kwara North, Chief Sunday Oyebiyi, the party chairman said that “there is only one body of state executive members and Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa remains her undisputed chairman. “Severally, party elders had tried to wade into the matter by meeting with the state APC chairman, Minister for Information and Culture and the leader of the party.

Their activities presuppose a parallel structure to the party structure and they bandied the name of the governor as giving approval to their activities. “Not once has the governor or his representative come out to denounce them.
