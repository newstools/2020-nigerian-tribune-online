Governor Nasiru El-Rufai of Kaduna State has said investors are free to come and explore the economic potentials of the state as the state rank number one in doing business in the country, saying the state has removed all bottlenecks that can prevent any investor from investing in the state. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair on Sunday, the governor said, “These efforts have been recognised in the most recent World Bank Doing Business Report which ranked Kaduna as the number one place for doing business in Nigeria. “It is a ranking that many investors can testify to and we intend to provide an attractive home for business and investors. “In our effort to foster this cause, we have made deliberate efforts to ensure peaceful co-existence in the state with the creation of the Kaduna Peace Commission and Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs noting that peace is cardinal to development.
