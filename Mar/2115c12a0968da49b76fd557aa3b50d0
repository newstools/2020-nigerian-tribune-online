Female ‘gangan’ drummer, Aralola Olumuyiwa, popularly known as “Ara,” has advised the Federal and Lagos State governments to create a hall of fame or museum to immortalise the late Victor Olaiya. Olumuyiwa gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos while paying tribute to the late doyen of highlife music. She said that the late highlife musician ought to be immortalised in a way that a museum should  be built where his musical compilations, biography, musical instruments, pictures and everything he engaged in while alive could be kept. She noted that the museum should be named after the musical icon. According to her, this will  afford the up-and-coming musicians the opportunity to learn from such icons. She added that the state and the  nation would  equally generate revenue from both local and international tourists that would be  visiting such a museum. She said, “Victor Olaiya’s music has already immortalised him. PDP set to cut staff strength by 50% Nigeria cannot survive without fundamental restructuring ―… Coronavirus: Lagos discharges 3 suspected patients from… No price too much to pay for security in Nigeria  —Ex AGF,… “Aside this, the Federal Government or Lagos State government should have a museum named after him where his musical compilations, pictures and all can be kept. “Ogun State government has done something like this for the  late Fela Anikulapo Kuti, we should have something similar for the highlife maestro too. “It is necessary to keep the  history of the man  because most of the aspiring artists and the younger generation will learn from him. “This will also generate good revenue for  the government and the family. “Sir Victor Olaiya will be greatly missed, he will not be forgotten in a hurry and may his soul rest in peace,” she said. The drummer commended  some musical companies for immortalising the musical icon even while alive, adding that more still needed to be done. She said  that the late Olaiya was an asset to the nation alongside his living contemporaries whose labour should be appreciated forever for raising the bars of  the African entertainment scene. Ara said that it was equally necessary to immortalise other legendary artists and artistes who had died for posterity sake. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
