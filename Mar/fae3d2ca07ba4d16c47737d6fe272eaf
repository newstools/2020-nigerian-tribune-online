President Trump announced new screening procedures Sunday morning, the day after the US recorded its first death from the coronavirus. In a tweet, Trump said people will be screened upon arriving if they are travelling from a “high-risk country.” It wasn’t clear which countries will receive the newer level of scrutiny. CNN has asked the White House for more information. On Saturday, the US recorded its first coronavirus death, adding to a growing list of infections circulating in communities without any clear source of infection. Of the 86,500 cases confirmed globally, at least 2,976 have been fatal — 2,870 of which were in China. The US has reached 71 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several of those cases are believed to have been spread person-to-person with unknown origins, including the patient in Washington state who died, said Dr Robert Redfield, director of the CDC. The patient was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions, according to Dr Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington.
