The PostMaster General of the Federation, Dr Ismail Adewusi, disclosed this at the unveiling of the solar products in Abuja, on Thursday. He said that the Federal Government was re-engineering and re-inventing NIPOST through collaboration with different stakeholders from the public and private sectors. According to him, the government is also leveraging on technology to present an array of innovative products and services aimed at meeting the divergent needs of Nigerians. “In recent time, globalisation, coupled with the growth in e-commerce aided with the advent of new communication technology, has forced many postal administrations to explore ways of expanding their frontiers.

From today, this service would be available in our post offices nationwide on demand by customers,” he said In his remarks, the Managing Director of Ukpa Hansa Energy Solutions Limited, Chief Ewie Aimienwauu, said the partnership with NIPOST was designed to address the issue of epileptic electricity situation in the country. He said that the idea was to take electricity to the homes of people living in remote parts of the country without the opportunity of connecting to the national grid. Aimienwauu said that the deal would see NIPOST distribute the solar energy products at its offices and post offices across the length and breadth of the country. He said that with the partnership, solar energy solutions would be provided to homes at affordable rates. According to him, it will address the challenge of difficulty of low-income households to enjoy stable electricity supply. “This partnership between NIPOST and Ukpa Hansa is one that will bring succour to Nigerians; give electricity to the remotest part of Nigeria where the hope for electricity from the national grid would not materialise, even in the next 10 years. “With this solution, electricity would no longer be a problem,” he said.
