Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has disclosed that he had a fruitful meeting with the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, over the current imbroglio between the Ekiti State government and some traditional rulers in the state. Following a query issued to 11 monarchs called PeluPelu Obas last week by the state government, Oba Adeyemi in a letter to the governor dated March 12, 2020, warned the governor against treating the traditional institution in Yorubaland with levity. Alaafin said unlike, in some tribes, where there was nothing attached to their traditional institutions, the Yoruba traditional institution was “ancestral and spiritual.” The affected Obas include Ewi of Ado-Ekiti Oba Rufus Adejugbe; Oloye of Oye Oba Oluwole Ademolaju; Elekole of Ikole Oba Adewumi Fasiku; Elemure of Emure Oba Emmanuel Ogunleye; Ajero of Ijero Oba Joseph Adewole; Alara of Aramoko, Oba Adegoke Adeyemi.
