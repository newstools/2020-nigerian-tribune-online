It has spread to about 50 countries now. Malaria kills more than COVID-19. Cancers kill more than COVID-19. Heart diseases kill more than COVID-19. I gave these facts to let you know that it isn’t anything to worry about as such.” He advised that it was important to observe basic personal hygiene in the form of frequent hand wash with soap and water or use alcohol-based sanitisers. “When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth with handkerchief and dispose of it immediately. If you don’t have handkerchief, cough or sneeze into your elbow. “Restrict handshake for the time being because If you observe these personal rules of hygiene, how are you sure that the other person does? And that is the problem. You should also reduce hugging at this time. “If you then observe that you are having symptoms of the disease, persistent cough, sneezing, fever, report to the doctor so that he can examine you but don’t find excuses for your symptoms. See the doctor and let him determine your state of health. “Helplines of Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) are also available at 08009700000 up to 10 lines. “And if you have someone around you who is manifesting any of these symptoms, advise the person to report to the hospital immediately and keep your distance from the individual.” Also speaking, Dr Titi Egbuson of the FCT Health Insurance Scheme warned against self-medication saying that the disease was still new and had no known cure so far. She warned against relying on social media for information as most of the information about COVID-19 are fake news. “Hand sanitisers have become so scarce but if you can get it, use it often. Refrain from touching your face because the virus affects the respiratory tract. “And you don’t have to wear face mask unless you are infected or suspect that you are infected and don’t want to spread it around.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
