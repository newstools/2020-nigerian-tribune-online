Cult members on Wednesday evening invaded the Benue State University campus and hacked a final year student of the university, Nate Nyiyongo, to death. The incident, according to one of the students who craved anonymity, happened around 7 pm. According to him, “the cultists chased the final year student of Political Science from outside the university campus into the campus, shot sporadically into the air while the security men scampered for safety. “The deceased student was chased through the gate down to the school library where they caught up with him and axed him mercilessly until he gave up. “Indeed, the cult members had a field day because no one could go closer.” ALSO READ: LGA polls: Gov Bello inaugurates SIEC, others, vows not to interfere with polls Another student who also does not want his name in print lamented the rising wave of cultism in the institution, noting that no fewer than five students mostly final year have been killed in cult rival clashes in the past few months. The student lampooned the management of the University for its failure to handle the situation, alleging that some children of management staff are members of cult groups. The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Professor Moses Kembe, who confirmed the killing said the cultists took advantage of the ongoing strike action. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the incident on phone, saying that one student was killed in Benue State University campus. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
