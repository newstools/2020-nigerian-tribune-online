The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has suspended the regular meeting of its Governing Body, expected to hold this month. The ILO said the decision was taken following a risk assessment and consultations with the Swiss authorities; adding that the Governing Body business will be dealt with later in the year. The organisation said in a release sent to our correspondent that the upcoming session of the ILO Governing Body (GB), originally scheduled for 12-26 March, will not take place in light of the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities to counter the spread of COVID-19. It said: “This follows a risk assessment by the ILO and consultations with the relevant cantonal authorities in accordance with the directive issued by the Swiss Federal Council on 28 February. The risk assessment took into account the fact that about 500 people from over 70 countries participate in the Governing Body.

It also requested organisers of events of less than 1,000 people, which includes the ILO GB meeting, to carry out a risk assessment to determine whether planned events should go ahead. “Governing Body business will be dealt with at its next sessions in May, June and November this year.” The release also said the ILO will continue to follow the guidance and advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Swiss authorities. The Governing Body of the International Labour Office is the executive body of the ILO. It comprises governments, workers and employers, and takes decisions on ILO policy, decides the agenda of the International Labour Conference, adopts the draft Programme and Budget of the Organisation and elects the Director-General.
