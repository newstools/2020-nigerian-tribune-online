A group, Academics Without Barriers (AWB), has decried the non-payment of salaries of lecturers on account that they failed to enrol on the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), describing the development as not too good enough and another recipe for disaster. National Coordinator of the group, Mallam Isa Abu, expressed this concern on Sunday in a signed statement, copy of which he made available to newsmen in Lagos, even as AWB further described the action on the part of the government as ”unthoughtful, lacking in basic intelligence, without defined, unified purpose.” ”It simply takes away the University autonomy,” the group declared, warning that the economic situation in the country would be more chaotic and worsened if the aggrieved lecturers down tools and Universities were closed down.

These University lecturers are human beings and they also have families to take care of. The economic situation in the country is tough and they deserve their salaries for them to discharge their duties effectively,” the group said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
