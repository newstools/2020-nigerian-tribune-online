Convener of the newly-introduced internet awards, Gage, Mr Johnson Anorh, has explained that the need to encourage Nigerians, especially the youths, to positively engage the internet, is a major reason for the introduction of the awards. Anorh, in an exclusive chat with Brands & Marketing, after a successful hosting of the maiden edition of the awards in Lagos, recently,  described as unfortunate the fact that  despite its many benefits for the users,  many individuals, in this part of the globe, had not really availed themselves of  the opportunities provided by the internet. He explained that the award was introduced by the company to recognise and celebrate individuals and brands that had leveraged such advantages to achieve results and carve a niche for themselves. “The internet has its many positives, as well as its downsides. Unfortunately, what we see on daily basis are the not-too-pleasant use of the internet. This development has not encouraged others to use the internet; since they are only seeing the negatives there.

That is why we are celebrating and showcasing those that have already leveraged these benefits to enhance themselves and their brands,” he added. According to him, some categories of the awards provided the audience the opportunity to nominate and make a choice, while others were decided by the panel, set up by the award committee. He reiterated the resolve of the organisers to keep refreshing the award so as to make it different from other existing ones. He stated that the word  Gage, a coinage from the word engage, was used to describe the award since most things the company does is about constantly engaging the online platform.
