There is heavy security presence in the ancient city of Kano following a rowdy session at the Kano House of Assembly over a move to submit a report recommending the removal of the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II on Monday. Also, there was apprehension as some residents who are loyal to the Emir took over the palace with a view to protest and express displeasure over any alleged unfavourable action meted to the Emir of Kano. It would be recalled that a petition was presented to the House by a group last week calling for the investigation of the Emir on an alleged violation of cultural and tradition of Kano. However, at the state assembly, it was a free-for-all on Monday when the Deputy Speaker and chairman of the Public Complaints and Petition Committee, Hamisu Ibrahim Chidari, raised observation over the ongoing investigation of petitions of an alleged violation of the culture, tradition and religious values of the people of Kano by Emir Muhammad Sanusi II. Trouble broke out when Chidari’s attempt to make his observation known to members was instantly opposed by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers.

In the process, the mace was instantly rescued by security men and the Sergeant of Arm attached to the Assembly. The fisticuff lasted for about 25 minutes before normalcy was restored in the House. The House thereafter proceeded on a 30 minutes break. As at the time of filling in this report, security has been beefed up at the Assembly to forestall any breakdown of law and order while hundreds of loyalists both for and against the Emir have been sighted at strategic places waiting for the outcome of what might likely occur. However, pressmen have been called to government house, where the state Commissioner of Information, Comrade Muhammed Garba, is likely to address members of the press over the incident Equally an emergency security meeting is holding as at the time of filing this report.
