Amidst the rising concern in number of the COVID-19 cases in Nigeria that could cause a total lockdown if the number rise unexpectedly in coming week, markets analyst expect the market sentiment to remain moderately weak. However, they expect long term investors to begin taking advantage of the valued stocks. “In our view, the trend witnessed this week is likely to persist, as weakening market sentiment in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic and the weakness across global markets are expected to pressure market returns. Nonetheless, we advise investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks,” Cordros Capital analyst said.
