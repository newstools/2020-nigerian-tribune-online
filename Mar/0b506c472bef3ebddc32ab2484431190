A group called Nigerians in Ireland (NIIRE) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to lock down the country completely as part of measures to stem the tide of the coronavirus pandemic. The group, in a statement signed by its coordinator, Dr Oluseyi Aba, also urged the Federal and state governments to ensure that Nigerians “get paid some stipend to enable them to cope with whatever economic consequences the total lockdown may create for them while it lasts.” While noting that a complete lockdown of the country will help curtail the spread of the virus, NIIRE stressed that government at all levels must provide some economic relief and palliative for citizens in the country. The group said, “We advise the government to either use voters registration database for the distribution of the stipend or use the data provided by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). “Nigeria should ration the money in the system. A state of emergency should be declared, salaries stopped monies redistributed to reach all Nigerian voters.” The group admonished Nigerians to practise social distancing, take all necessary personal hygiene tips and follow the directives of the government even as government battles to curtail the virus.
