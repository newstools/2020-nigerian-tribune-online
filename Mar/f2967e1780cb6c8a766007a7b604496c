The Oyo State government has frowned at the collection of revenue from commercial vehicle operators by some unauthorised persons, noting that it will bring the full weight of the law upon such individuals. State Commissioner for Public Works and Transport, Professor Raphael Afonja, who sounded this warning, said only the park managers and agents engaged by a consultant to the state government were empowered to collect revenue from commercial vehicle operators. Afonja, represented by Mr Bolaji Oyekanmi, gave the warning on Wednesday, during a one-day capacity training for agents recruited for the daily collection of revenue at motor parks across the 33 local government areas in the state. While noting that the state government had activated measures to curb the illegal collections, Afonja said it was high time such illegal revenue collectors exercised restraint.

He avowed that the application of modern technology will go a long way to block leakages in revenue collection. Speaking, consultant to the state government on the project, Mosun Obembe, said an electronically generated ticket will be issued to operators of taxicabs, tricycles and motorcycles on daily basis to ensure levies are appropriately remitted into the state’s coffers. She added that the operations of the agents would be in sync with the park management system, recently introduced by the state government. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
