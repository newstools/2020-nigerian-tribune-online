THE Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba Ewuare II has denied the rumours making the rounds in Benin City, the Edo State capital, to the effect that he has ordered that no one should sweep his or her house for three days so as to avert the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement on Sunday in Benin City by Mr Frank Irabor, the secretary, Benin Traditional Council (BTC), he denounced the information as untrue, false and not a directive from the revered Benin monarch. Irabor explained that the historical Benin City is known for its constant beauty, adding that before any government started precautionary measures to control the spread of the dreaded disease, the traditional ruler had made special sacrifices of appeasement to protect Edo people from the virus. According to the spokesman, the Omo N’Oba had long ago also advised the people to practice the simple hygienic rules of regular washing of hands with water and soap and use of sanitisers, covering the mouth with handkerchief or serviette or coughing into the elbow, as well as staying at home and reporting any suspected illness to the nearest health facility. He warned: “The palace also warns that those peddling the spurious rumour on social media should desist from such acts otherwise, they will incur the wrath of God and our ancestors.” Irabor added: “The Omo N’Oba prays for the good health of all Edo people and a coronavirus free Nigeria.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE   YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buy and read digital replicas of your TRIBUNE titles by subscribing through E-VENDING BREAKING: UCH CMD Tests Positive For Coronavirus The Chief Medical doctor, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Prof Jesse A Otegbayo, has tested positive for coronavirus.
