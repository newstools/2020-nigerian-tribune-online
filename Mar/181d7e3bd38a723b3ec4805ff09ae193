A cheating husband who caught coronavirus on a secret break to Italy with his mistress is now in isolation in the UK with his wife who has no idea how he caught it. The woman has no idea how her partner caught Covid-19 but the man confessed to medical coordinators in the north of England. The cheating husband told them that he contracted the virus while he was on a secret holiday in the hotspot. The ‘well-heeled’ male who The Sun reports works in a ‘high-flying job’ refused to name the mystery female he’s been seeing. A source told the paper: ‘His case would be funny if it wasn’t quite so serious. The man confessed what he’d been up to in Italy, and that his wife has no idea. ‘She thinks he just picked up the disease on his business trip away. Although the patient admitted to medics what had happened, he said nothing would persuade him to name his mistress.’ It comes as the UK’s total number of confirmed cases sits at 1,543. Fifty-six people are known to have died from the virus in Britain.
