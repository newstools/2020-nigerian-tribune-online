The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad on Friday, swore in Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, as the Acting President of the Court of Appeal. The swearing-in ceremony, which took place at the ceremonial court of the Supreme Court in Abuja, followed Justice Dongban-Mensem’s appointment as acting President of the appellate court by President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday. The National Judicial Council (NJC) had earlier nominated Justice Dongban-Mensem to the President for appointment into the office of President of the Court of Appeal, as the most senior Justice after Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, who retired on Friday, having attained the mandatory retirement age of 70 years. The CJN, who expressed confidence in her abilities, described her as “A seasoned judicial officer who has been in the system for a long time”. The CJN said, “She knows the work very well and she has been doing her job satisfactorily well. “It was her hard work that has enticed both the Court of Appeal and the National Judicial Council to uplift her to the position of the President of the Court of Appeal”, the CJN said and urged her to continue to be charismatic and carry out her tasks diligently.
