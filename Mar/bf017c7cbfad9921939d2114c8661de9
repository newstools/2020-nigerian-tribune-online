However, Director in charge of Tax Operations Group at FIRS, Mr Olufemi Oluwaniyi, said about half of the target relates to upstream oil business but the revenue from companies involved for 2019 is less than half of expectations. “Due to the international dimensions of issues affecting the sector, the results are largely out of our control. “By the way, the payment arrangements in that sector are such that January 2020 payment is still based on the previous year (2019) business.” He also explained that the new administration just came into office and was settling down to reposition the Service. “Again, the economy, in general terms, experienced a serious downturn occasioned by the outbreak of the coronavirus with consequential reduction in consumption & purchasing power. “Collection in consumption-based tax like VAT could, therefore, not reach the planned level.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
