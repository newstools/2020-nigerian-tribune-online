Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, said it is distressed by the Abule Ado, Lagos explosion that killed an unspecified number of people on Sunday and destroyed yet to be enumerated property, calling for an open inquiry into the incident which it noted was coming three weeks after the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tanko Buratai, announced the presence of Boko Haram in the state. Afenifere expressed this concern on Monday in a released issued by its national publicity secretary, Mr Yinka Odumakin, copy of which was made available to Tribune Online, even as it said its hearts go to all the families who were victims of the great tragedy who perished in the sad occurrence. “Our hearts go to all the families who are victims of this great tragedy as we pray for the repose of all souls who perished in the sad occurrence,” the group said.

We mourn,” the group added. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
