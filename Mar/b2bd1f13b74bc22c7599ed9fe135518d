A Federal High Court in Kano, Court one, presided over by Justice Lewis Allagoa had, on Thursday, set aside a court ruling sacking the National chairman of All Progressive Congress (APC), Chief Adam Oshiomole. Given the ruling on the interim injunction, Justice Allagoa ordered the various parties to maintain the status quo, pending the hearing and determination of the case Justice Alagoa then ordered that the status quo ante Bellum be maintained, pending the hearing of the motion on notice by the applicant, Aliyu Muhammad Rabiu. It would be recalled that Rabiu had, on the 4th March 2020, filed a motion exparte against All Progressive Congress (1st respondent), Adams Oshiomhole, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Inspector General of Police and Director-General of State Security Service as 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th respondents.
