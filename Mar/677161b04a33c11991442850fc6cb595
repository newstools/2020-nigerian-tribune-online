Association of Licensed Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria (ALPSPN) has called for the amendment of the laws to permit private security outfits to bear arms while at their duty posts. National President of the association, Wilson Esangbedo, made this call when he led the executive members of the association to meet with the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola in his office in Abuja. Section 17 of Private Guard Decree, 1986 as amended in 2004 forbids private security guards from bearing arms and ALPSPN’s president said this placed members of the association at a disadvantaged position whilst limiting their potentials to help reduce insecurity across the nation. Esangbedo said an amendment of the law to allow private security guards to carry arms, was a move will free up about 216,000 policemen for core police duties. Esangbedo revealed that the association has over 1000 licensed security companies across the country represented in each of the 36 states. He said such an amendment to the law would enable private security outfits provide security at their various levels to complement the whole. 18 suspected cases of Coronavirus identified so far in… Coronavirus: Lagos discharges 3 suspected patients from… Tambuwal: Govt will decide on NECO fees payment next week Court restrains Kano anti-graft agency from investigating… According to him, such licence would facilitate increased security to persons and property already countries like Rwanda, Morocco and South Africa are success stories in this direction.

He said there are over 100 registration requests seeking government approval “Reasons for holding back registration of [private security guard] companies is to ensure that we don’t register just anybody under this government. We want to be sure of the integrity of people involved.” “Secondly, we are working on a regulation that will encourage efficiency. We are packaging regulation that will make you smart, efficient and effective,” he added. He also called for more collaboration between the ALPSPN members and state security architecture for intelligence sharing. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
