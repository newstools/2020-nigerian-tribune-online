The Association of Waterwell Drilling Rig Owners and Practitioners (AWDROP), Oyo State chapter has re-elected Kolawole Olayinka as substantive chairman, after resolving the association’s leadership crisis which was occasioned by the N30,000 permit by the Oyo State Government. It would be recalled that the state government since the administration of Abiola Ajimobi imposed a fee of N30,000 on borehole drillers in the state. Borehole drillers had kicked against this permit introduced by the state government through the Ministry of Environment. This, however, led to dispute among borehole drillers who resorted to remove the state chairman, Kolawole Olayinka, with the allegation that he was the brain behind the permit debacle. As a result, a meeting was summoned which was presided by the zonal vice-president of the association, Alhaji Oluwatoyin Yusuf where members of the association resolved to embrace peace and to choose a substantive chairman and executive members to stir affair of the state association.
