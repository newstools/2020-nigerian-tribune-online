Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN) has advocated free and compulsory education for every girl child in the country and Africa as a whole. Speaking with journalists during a walk to mark world women’s day in Ilorin, Kwara State at the weekend, the Ilorin branch chairpersons of the association, Oluwatoyin Babatunde, said free and compulsory education for women would enable rapid socio-economic development and growth in all African nations. “It will be quite impressive if education is free for every girl child. It will be an avenue to promote and encourage education among women in Africa and it would surely have an impact in rapid transformation of the continent” she said. Talking on the theme of the celebration: an equal world is an enabled world, Babatunde said the theme signified that the world should ensure equality in all ramifications of life. “We’re saying that gender inequality is not all about women, but it’s about race, religion, world issues, economic, equal opportunity in every aspect of life for everyone. This is in line with the mission and vision of the association, which tends to promote excellence in professionalism among women engineers and women engineers as leaders. Also to promote awareness of girl child education in the field of engineering.

And everybody should be involved in solving the problems we have”, she said.
