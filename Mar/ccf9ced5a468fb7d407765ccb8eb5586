The House of Representatives on Tuesday called on National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on the need to put necessary mechanisms in place with the view to checkmate abusive use of drugs and narcotics among Nigerian youths. The resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon. Omowunmi Ogunlola who decried the wrong usage of drugs and narcotics manufactured to combat health challenges by various age grades. While stressing the need for all the health sector regulatory agencies to be alive to their responsibilities as provided in the relevant Acts by ensuring that this ugly trend is checkmated, the lawmakers also urged Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) to exercise control by ensuring that only qualified Pharmacists are allowed to run Pharmaceutical shops. In her lead debate, Hon. Ogunlola expressed grave concern over the “rate that drugs are abused mainly by the youths which has reached an alarming rate, with its attendant consequences given that the youths are the future of any country and if a sizeable number of youths continually engage in drugs abuse, it may spell doom for the future of the nation. “The House also notes that it was in appreciation of the need to combat the above situation that the Federal Government established the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control to eradicate the menace of drug abuse.
