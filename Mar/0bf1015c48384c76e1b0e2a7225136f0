She said, “NAFDAC is not approving Chloroquine as a product that can be used for Coronavirus because there is no submission to us for registration. But because NAFDAC approves medicines meant for clinical trials, the agency has approved Chloroquinne just for clinical trials alone and not for treatment of the virus,” Adeyeye said. She, however, called on researchers and experts who are interested in engaging in clinical trial on Chloroquine to approach NAFDAC approved outlets. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
