The acting national secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Victor Giadom, has said the national working committee would respect court judgment asking the embattled national chairman of the ruling party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to vacate his seat. Justice Danlami Senchi of the Federal High Court in Abuja had, on Wednesday, asked Congress Oshiomhole to vacate his office, pending the determination of a suit seeking his removal as national chairman of the ruling party. Addressing newsmen yesterday, Giadom said the party would defer to all lawful court judgments. He said: “The injunction is binding on us. We will respect the judgment. As a party, we are aware of the injunction. As a law-abiding party, we will respect all lawful court orders. Very soon the National Working Committee will meet and you will hear further from the party. I am trying to say that the All Progressives Congress will respect all lawful court orders. We will soon do that.” Asked about heavy police presence, Honourable Giadom said it was nothing unusual.
