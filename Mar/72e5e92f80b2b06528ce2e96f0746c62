The Management of APM Terminals Apapa said on Monday that it had placed orders for more equipment to cope with the significant growth at the Lagos Port. The clarification is coming on the heels of a report that the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had issued a 30-day ultimatum to the terminal operator to address alleged lapses, which has reportedly resulted in port congestion. The ultimatum, which was reportedly given to the company last month, would expire this week. Speaking on the development, the Managing Director of APM Terminals Apapa, Mr. Martin Jacob said, “Due to the conducive economic environment coupled with the closure of the border with Benin, Lagos ports witnessed a spike in volume as cargo was diverted from Cotonou, with periods such as October witnessing up to 50% Year-on-Year growth of imports. “APM Terminals Apapa has expedited the investment in additional equipment, with the first batch of three cranes already in operation after arriving within the last month.

The 55-hectare facility has 1,005m quay length, 13.5m draft alongside with an annual handling capacity of 1.2million TEU. So far, APM Terminals Apapa said it had invested N130billion in infrastructure, IT upgrades and modern container handling equipment to improve both quayside and landside operations.
