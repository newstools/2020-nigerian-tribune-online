 The coronvirus pandemic  has grounded the operations of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) to a halt. According to findings, the acting chairman of the Commission, Ibrahim Magu has ordered that some measures  be put in place to ensure that the virus is contained in the commission’s facility across the country. A source in Abuja told Sunday Tribune that Magu gave the directives following complaints by some personnel of the commission that he should have been in self-isolation, following his return from Dubai the United Arab Emirates last Sunday. According to the source, the measures include barring all kinds of visitors to EFCC offices, decongest cells, reschedule interviews with suspects and provision of safety health facilities, amongst others. It was gathered that the measures would be in force for two weeks after which it may be reviewed. According to a top official of the Commission, Mr Magu, rather than self-isolate, “Just came from Dubai over the weekend and has been in the office since Monday working, directing, mingling and leading his staff members like everything is normal. When are we going to stop this executive rascality?
