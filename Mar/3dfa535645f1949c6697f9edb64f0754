Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, on Thursday, said the coming Science and Technology Expo will provide employment opportunities for unemployed youths who are roaming the streets to acquire the needed skills to actualize their potentials. He stated this in Abuja during the inspection of the facilities put in place for the event. According to him: “There is no region or state that is not blessed with one resource or the other.” Dr Onu, who, therefore, envisaged technological innovations which will be displayed during the programme could be tapped into by all unemployed youths, added that Nigeria is blessed with good weather, mineral resources, and fertile and productive land, hence the need to tap from there.
