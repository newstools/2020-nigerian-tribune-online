Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi has tested positive for coronavirus, the club has confirmed. It follows the diagnosis of Bianconeri teammate Daniele Rugani earlier in the month amid Italy becoming one of the worst-hit places by the pandemic. A statement on Tuesday confirmed that French star Matuidi, 32, is well having been tested after Rugani contracted the illness. It read: “Blaise Matuidi has undergone medical tests that have come back positive for coronavirus.

He will continue to be monitored and will follow the same regime. “He is well and is asymptomatic.” The number of coronavirus cases in Italy tipped 31,500 on Tuesday with 2,503 dead – a rise of 16 per cent in the past 24 hours. Serie A was the first European league to start postponing games before joining the swell of sporting events being placed on hold to prevent the virus from spreading. Juventus had tested their players once Rugani’s positive result came back, with Cristiano Ronaldo retreating to his hometown of Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Meanwhile, center-back Rugani, 25, has insisted he is in good health despite contracting the illness. He stated earlier this week: “I’m fine, I’ve been pretty good. “I haven’t had the symptoms you read about in the news. “I was lucky despite it being a good hit because I was the first in our squad to get it. I hope it will serve to raise awareness.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
