The management of Brendance and Crusaders Limited has unveiled the 2020 edition of Mr and Miss Nigeria International themed “The Rebirth”. While this year’s event is targeted at repackaging and revamping the brand, the pageant, Mr. and Miss Nigeria International, is a production that sets up standards for individuals with interest in pageantry and a commitment to see them at pageant competitions and modelling. ‘The Rebirth’ will also open doors to contestants from winners of Miss Nigeria International as they will be competing in Miss Africa in South Africa and Ms. World USA, while winners of Mr Nigeria will compete for Mr Landscape in China.
