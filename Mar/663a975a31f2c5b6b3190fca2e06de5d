The governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, has commissioned 80 units of Ford Galaxy vehicles in partnership with the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) to boost transportation in the State, which is one of the backbone of economic activities and a facilitator of business and human interaction. Speaking during the commissioning in Jos, Governor Lalong said 80 vehicles were in fulfilment of the commitment the administration made to the officials of the NURTW Plateau State Chapter during its courtesy call to his office. He said it will enable NURTW members to have access to transport vehicles that will not only assist them and their families but also have a multiplier effect on the creation of wealth in the State. “As a government that has passion for empowering its citizens, I had no hesitation in approving the request of the Union and directing the release of funds for the purchase of the buses. Moreover, members of the Union had raised 50 per cent of the amount.

Governor Lalong called on the NURTW to sensitise its members on the need to remain law-abiding and treat passengers with dignity and courtesy while avoiding any activities that can cause a breach of the law.
