The House of Representatives on Monday gave the immediate past Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, FMBN, Mr. Richard Esin, a 48 hours ultimatum within which to render the Accounts of the Bank or face severe sanction. The Chairman of the Committee, Rep. Wole Oke gave the directive in Abuja at the resumed hearing into refusal of Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs of government to render their Accounts to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation from 2014 to date when the Management of the Bank appeared before it along with the former MD. Also, the Committee summoned the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Mr. Godwin Emeifele, the Director of Finance and Administration, of the Bank over the development, saying that it was disheartening the ways and manners public officers were playing with tax player’s money put in their care by not rendering proper Accounts as an when due.

Reps shocked as 2 Rectors run Federal Poly Reps support ease of doing business, pass CAMA bill through… Reps to investigate CBN, others over alleged $30 billion… Reps to probe NIS, Nigerian passport racket syndicates In a swift reaction to this, the Committee described it as unacceptable and sought for the opinion of the representative of the Auditor General of the Federation on the implication of the action of the former FMBN boss and its management who described it as a gross violation of the law which should be seriously sanctioned to serve as a deterrent to other MDAs. The former FMBN boss in his own defence claimed that he met the situation on ground o assumption of office which the Committee also dismissed as unacceptable and directed him to do all things possible within the next 48 hours to get the Accounts ready, transmit to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation and the proof of same to be brought before the Committee.
