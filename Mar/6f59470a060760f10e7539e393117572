Bissau interim President Cipriano Cassama stepped down on security concerns, two days after he was sworn into the post. “An interim president needs to have all the security conditions to fulfil his duties,” Cassama told reporters in the capital Bissau Sunday. “Today my life’s in danger, my family’s life’s in danger, the population’s life’s in danger. That’s why I’ve decided to resign,” he said. Cassama was sworn in by lawmakers late Friday after the ruling party deemed the swearing-in a day earlier of Umaro Sissoco Embalo, the winner of December elections was illegal. Cassama said he would retain his post as parliament speaker.
