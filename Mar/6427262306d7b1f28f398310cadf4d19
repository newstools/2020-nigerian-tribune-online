The private member bill initiated by the Speaker was presented on the floor of the chamber by the Deputy Majority Leader, Hon. Noheem Adams, and was repeatedly commended by lawmakers at the plenary session held yesterday at the Chambers. While laying the report, The Chairman, House Committee on Health, Hon Hakeem Sokunle, said that the bill number 8 of the house scaled three readings in quick succession given the urgent requirements, to ensure the bill is speedily dispensed with. He explained that the bill would aid the containment of the coronavirus pandemic and gives the governor authorisation to spend a kick-off expenditure not more than N20bn and to make recourse back to the house before any regulations. The Chairman added that the bill also affords a fine of N100,000 for defaulters, one-month incarceration in the correctional centre or three-month community service. He said that where the offences are not spelt out, it attracts N200,000 and also allows the leadership of the various arms of government to structure their own restrictions format. Hakeem said that section 8 of the bill made provision for the Coronavirus trust fund, the bill also empowers the governor to declare a state of emergency up to three months. During the deliberation after the laying of the Report, Hon Adedamola Kasunmu, representing Ikeja Constituency 2, noted that it is important to alleviate the impact of Coronavirus on the economy of Lagos.

Pandemics are not new but the way government and people react to it matters. It is in 150 states in the world. “Lagos recorded the first case; So, they should look at the possibility to broaden it to capture much more,” he said. Representing Somolu constituency I, Hon. Rotimi Olowo noted that the spread of the virus is unprecedented; hence, stringent measures should be taken to forestall the pandemic. He also added that the bill should be alive for live. Representing Ibeju-Lekki constituency 1, Hon Fatai Mojeed counselled that the governor’s pronouncement should be binding on all, including the traditional medicine practitioners, the churches and mosques. The Chief Whip of the House, Hon Mojisola Meranda, noted that there should provision in the law to ensure patients of the virus who might have been certified okay after the treatment should be reabsorbed back into the society. In his ruling, the Speaker of the House, Hon Mudashiru Obasa, stated that the contingency plan afforded in the budget cannot sort it out. He explained that the House is creating and guiding the governor from acting outside the law, saying that the government needs to be seen doing something by making effective pronouncements. “Governor can make a recourse back to the house if need be. If the budget procedure takes much time that can’t suffice, the kick-off fund will help,” the Speaker said. The House adjourns sitting till April 2nd,2020. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
