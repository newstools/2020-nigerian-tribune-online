Wife of the Anambra State governor and founder of a NGO, Caring Family Enhancement Initiative (CAFE), Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, has called on recalcitrant young mothers to desist from dumping their newborn babies for any reason. She entreated that such mothers should rather ensure that the ‘unwanted’ babies be kept adequately warm and placed at accessible places where they can be found, recovered and duly catered for. Mrs Obiano made the plea in Awka, over the weekend, while reacting to the news about a newborn baby recovered on top of barbwire perimeter fence where it was dumped by a young mother in Oko, Anambra State.

I can’t imagine such a desperate act at a time when many families are earnestly searching for the fruit of the womb. Please, let it be known that rather than wasting their lives, many good Nigerians and CAFE are ready to assist and get such babies to appropriate orphanages.” She expressed relief over the news that the recovered baby is now stable and is responding to treatment. She also cautioned against recurrence, counselling that those thinking along that line should desist and do the right thing. Nigerian Tribune learnt that a newborn baby girl was reportedly thrown away over a fence by a young mother suspected to be a student of Federal Polytechnic Oko, Anambra State but was later rescued by some good Samaritans.
