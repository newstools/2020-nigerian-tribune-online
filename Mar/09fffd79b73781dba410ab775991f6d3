Our desire to educate them was to empower our community and change our collective lives and reach beyond the invisible lines that poverty and culture did not allow us to cross. “Our dreams are dashed and our hope deferred and the nightmare we live daily has no end.” According to it, we lay our tears at your feet, dear Sisters, and we put our hands in yours to receive strength to rise from the shackles that have imprisoned us and our children. “We know that as we walk through this storm, you will lift our heads and shine a light on our path knowing that when we collectively illuminate the path, all can see and see clearer too.
