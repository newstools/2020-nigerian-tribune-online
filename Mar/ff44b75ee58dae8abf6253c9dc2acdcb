The Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Alhaji Dawud Akinola, has commended the various steps being taken by governments in the South-West to contain the spread of coronavirus. The commendation was contained in a statement issued in Ibadan by the Secretary to the Aare Musulumi-Council, Alhaji Kamoru Aderibigbe. The Muslim leader noted that the coronavirus pandemic posed a grave danger to human existence and only drastic measures such as the ones being taken and replicated among governments, particularly in the South-West, could effectively address the challenge. He identified the suspension of social and religious gatherings, schools’ closure, work break for civil and public servants after payment of their salary, provision of handwashing facilities in public places, provision of special health care facilities as well as massive sensitisation by government functionaries as right steps in the right direction.
