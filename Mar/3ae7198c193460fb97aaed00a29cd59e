The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami has charged Federal government institutions to obey the Presidential Executive order  003 in public procurement processes as a means of improving local content in the automobile industry. Giving this charged on Monday at the unveiling of Made-in Nigeria vehicles in Abuja by the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Pantami lamented that lack of enforcement of the order had further encouraged patronage of imported vehicles totally neglecting the need to build local content for the sector. According to him, “when it comes to the automobile industry in Nigeria, the main challenge is not about laws or policies, but rather implementation or enforcement. With this, I encourage my colleague (referring to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment) to do what is necessary to ensure that from now henceforth, our federal public institutions must give priority and preference to our indigenous technology when it comes to automobile. “The same even goes for the private sector, this is very possible with the Executive Order we have in place, Executive Order 003 which was signed in 2017 and Presidential Order of 2018. I believe these two orders will go a long way in supporting you to ensure the enforcement of our local content” he noted. Pantami stated further that “Most of our local content manufacturers are not supported in any way, we agitated for local content or indigenous content but when it comes to patronage, we always give priority or preference to what has been imported into our country.

Responding, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Richard Otunba Adebayo said the country was moving forward in the area locally assembling vehicles. “From zero production level in 2012, the industry has recorded thousand of newly assembled vehicles in the country. “However, with the launch of a Ten (10) Automotive Industrial Development Plan (NAIDP) in 2013, 62 companies to date are registered to assemble vehicle at SKG and  CKG levels with a combined total installed capacity 423,790 units, the actual assembling of 10, 343 units have been achieved so far.
