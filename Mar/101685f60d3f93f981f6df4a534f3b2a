Dr Mercy Ekele, a Public Health expert, has underscored the need for increased awareness of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancer and the importance of vaccination for both young women and men in the country. Ekele said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria(NAN), on Wednesday in Abuja, on the occasion of the International HPV Awareness Day. NAN reports that March 4, has now been established as International HPV Awareness Day. The commemoration is part of the International Papilloma Society’s commitment to increase worldwide understanding of HPV and how it affects us all. The expert said though HPV affects everyone, not many people have heard of it, saying that the bad news is that some HPV infections could lead to life-threatening cancer. She added that “the good news was that Nigerians could join the global community to stop HPV.” She noted that Nigerians needed to be sure that they protected themselves, get a pap-smear, and ask their doctors about the HPV vaccination. According to her, over 80 per cent of people will be infected by HPV human papillomavirus at some point. They are a few that can hurt the nation. Ekele who listed other cancers to include cervical, anal, oral and penile said that “HPV causes one in 20 cancers worldwide. The HPV virus causes: “most cases of cervical cancer nine out of 10 vulva and anal cancers, eight out of 10 vaginal cancers and nine out of 10 cases of genital warts,” she said. She called on the Federal Ministry of Education to offer the free HPV vaccine to all secondary school pupils in the country as part of the schools’ vaccination programme, because HPV virus infection was most common in people in their late teens and early 20s.
