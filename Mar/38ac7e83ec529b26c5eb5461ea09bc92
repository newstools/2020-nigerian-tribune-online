This is my first pregnancy. I am now 30 weeks gone and my baby is still breech. During my last visit to my doctor, he proposed giving me a Caesarean Section if the baby’s position still remains the same. I have heard a lot of scary stories about the operation, so I don’t want it. Kindly advise me.

Caesarean Section (CS) is the most appropriate treatment if the baby’s position remains what it is. That way, you will be sure that your baby will be delivered safely while your own life will be adequately protected.There is nothing to be afraid of in a CS. Even some mothers usually elect to have the surgery which, when carried out by competent hands, is very safe and reliable. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
