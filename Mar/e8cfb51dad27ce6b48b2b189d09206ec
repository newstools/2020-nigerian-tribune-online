The removal of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) by a pronouncement of the Federal High Court has thrown up a leadership challenge in the party. The former Oyo State governor, Senator Isiaka Ajimobi, whose approval as Deputy National Chairman was announced today (Wednesday) may emerge as acting chairman. By the provision of Article 14.2 of the APC Constitution 2010( as amended) the Deputy National Chairman, South should assume the exalted office of Chairman of the party in an acting capacity.
