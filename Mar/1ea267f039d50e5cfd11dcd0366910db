Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, has criticised the response of the Nigerian government to the coronavirus that has affected 46 people in the country. Soyinka, who lives in Nigeria which has 46 cases of COVID-19, spoke with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in Lagos, saying that the government should have had enough isolation centres, well-stocked pharmacies and research centres that would have helped deal with the crisis. He also took a swipe at some churches and mosques which ignored government directives about social distancing, saying the government treated them with kid gloves. According to him: “They (churches and mosques) have been treated with kid gloves for too long. I think there is too much political correctness going on. “What the government should do in such instances is to take note of these contraveners of common sense and ensure that they are punished after this crisis is over or at some point or the other. “We have to take on churches and mosques, religions of any kind including traditional religions that misbehave and let them understand that they are living in very different times than that of their imagination.” Soyinka said the government should have had enough isolation centres, well-stocked pharmacies and research centres that would have helped deal with the crisis. Prof Soyinka has been in self-isolation for nine days after returning from the United States. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
