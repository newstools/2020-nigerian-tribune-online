GOVERNOR of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, has tasked religious leaders in Nigeria to use their sacred positions and influence to emphasise the need for their followers to be honest and law-abiding in search of their means of livelihood. Makinde made the charge recently during a special dinner organised as part of activities to round off the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria which held in Ibadan. The governor, who was represented by his Executive Assistant, Idowu Ogedengbe, noted that Nigerians were quick to obey religious leaders stating that the same should be the case between the government and the governed. He commended the C&S Unification for not relenting in preaching the undiluted words of God using hymns, songs and exhibiting same in their way of life.
