But we have already established rules here that anybody who has been to China will be self-quarantined. “Chikwe has gone (to China) and come back and has done the test. It’s negative, but we have insisted that he must undergo the 14-days of quarantine which is why he is not here today. “It’s not allowed to come out until after 14-days because if you make rules, you must also obey them, which is to set an example for Nigerians that the head of NCDC is self-quarantine as we speak. He’s very well but he has to follow the rules.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
