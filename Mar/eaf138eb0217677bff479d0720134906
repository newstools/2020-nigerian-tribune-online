What I have seen is that for a lot of young professionals, it is difficult to find out what is happening in the industry, and how they can play a role that could be fitting in the capabilities and interests they have. So, we have brought them together to sensitise them on who we are as a company and hope to ignite the interest of these young professionals,” she said. “We are constantly addressing how we can accommodate and make women professionals climb up the ladder and for them to also see the vision of reaching top management positions.” The Managing Director of APM Terminals, Apapa, Martin Jacob, who received the young women at the terminal, reiterated the company’s commitment to promoting gender diversity.
