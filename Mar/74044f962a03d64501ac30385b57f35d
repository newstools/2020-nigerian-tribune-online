Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has dispelled rumor making the rounds that Sokoto state government has taken a position that it won’t pay the National Examination Council (NECO) fees for indigenes of the state who failed a mock examination conducted by the state ministry for basic and secondary school education. Governor Tambuwal debunked the allegation when he received the report of a committee set up by the state government on the recruitment of 2000 teachers Friday. According to him, the rumor being peddled “is not the final position of the government. By the time we seat next week, we will be able to reach a final position on that,” after consulting the relevant stakeholders. A statement by the special adviser on media and publicity to the governor, Mohammed Bello, said the governor has assured that his administration will establish an institute that will function solely to train and re-train teachers in the state. 18 suspected cases of Coronavirus identified so far in… Coronavirus: Lagos discharges 3 suspected patients from… Insecurity: Private security outfits seek arm licence Court restrains Kano anti-graft agency from investigating… ALSO READ: EFCC parades three bank officials, two others for fraud in Sokoto The governor said the institute will be solely for Sokoto State teachers who will be trained batch by batch. “Most of the graduates today don’t have a teaching background because that aspect of their training has been phased out. I believe that setting up the institute will address the shortcomings in our graduates.” He commended members of the committee for a job well done, “having taken time, painstakingly, to do the job requested of you, especially in the area of screening and ensuring that you bring out the best of the best of those who applied for the job; and ensuring spread and reflection of the state in the exercise. “I have taken note of the special situation of certain local governments in the state that requires some intervention in order to boost their drive for educational development. I have also taken note of most of the issues you have raised. I am sure most of it are contained in this report. We shall study them one after the other,” he said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
