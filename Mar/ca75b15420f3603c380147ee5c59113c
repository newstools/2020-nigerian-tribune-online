The vice chancellor of the First Technical University, Ibadan, Oyo State, Professor Ayobami Salami, says the university believes in best practices, and its students must operate along that line. He told new students being matriculated for the 2019/2020 academic session recently that there is no room for absenteeism, truancy, cultism, internet fraud, examination malpractice or other vices in the institution. “The university is founded on knowledge, practice, talent and character; so we do not allow anyone to smear our reputation,” he said. Professor Salami spoke at length about the comparative advantage Tech-U has over universities of technology and other conventional institutions, including, according to him, its “rich emphasis on employment-preparation skills.” He said with attachments, apprenticeships and internships, there is an assurance of competence and better preparedness in Tech-U students. “With the efficient usage of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education and TVET to secure a better future for Nigerian youths, Tech-U seeks to midwife the country’s economic development through the provision of market-ready graduates.

These were first class students who had been able to score a cumulative grade point average or 4.5 and above (on the scale of 5.0). Professor Salami said they would also receive N10,000 every month courtesy of Josephus Foundation. However, the two best students for the session – Maryam Afonja 300 Level and Amos Olaleye 200 Level with a perfect CGPA score of 5.0 – will both receive N15,000 every month effective from January, 2020.
