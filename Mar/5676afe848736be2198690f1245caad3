FOLLOWING an index case of the Coronavirus disease recorded in Lagos State, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), on Sunday, said the orientation course for the 2020 Batch A Corps Members will hold in all its 37 orientation camps across the country. This was even as it denied reports on the postponement of the exercise, scheduled to commence on 10th March. In a statement issued by the Corps in Abuja and signed by the Director Of Public Relations,Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, NYSC said it has put in place preventive measures. The statement partly read: “The attention of the Management of National Youth Service Corps has been drawn to a false and very misleading story circulating on the social media making allusion to the postponement of the 2020 Batch A orientation programme, scheduled to commence nationwide on 10th March 2020, arising from the Coronavirus scare.

As a proactive action, it has put in place certain preventive measures in the 37 orientation camps of the scheme, in order to guard against the contraction of the highly contagious virus by the corps members.” Also, it disclosed that its secretariats have stepped up the sensitisation of serving corps members, as well as other Nigerians on things to know about the virus, particularly the preventive measures to be adopted. “Accordingly, Management wishes to emphatically state that the orientation course for the 2020 Batch A Corps Members shall hold nationwide as earlier publicised. “Kindly disregard the hoax created by mischief makers to cause unnecessary anxiety among the PCMs,” it added.
