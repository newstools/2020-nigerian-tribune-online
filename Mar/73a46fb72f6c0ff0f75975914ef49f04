Lagos State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu to order for large quantities of masks and sanitizers for distribution to Lagosians free to safeguard them from contacting the deadly coronavirus instead of accusing traders of inflating costs of the items. This was as the party urged that the free masks, among others, must get into public and private schools, motor parks, ministries and Agencies as well as other public places within 72 hours, vowing: ”We will advise parents and other Lagosians to stay home after the timeline unless this governor and government get serious about funding the needful in curbing this virus.” ALSO READ: Senate President tasks religious leaders to intensify prayer for those in leadership positions The party made the call in a statement signed by its publicity secretary, Mr Taofiq Gani, copy of which was made available to newsmen, in reaction to Governor Sanwo-Olu’s frowning on traders who tried to exploit Lagosians by jerking up prices of the products.

According to the party, such funding would also enable the relevant ministries and agency to undertake preventive measures and ensuring that health personnel visit public places, homes and hospitals to inspect patients as many hospitals might not willingly disclose their covid-19 patients. PDP, while saying that “the Sanwo-Olu administration must be held responsible for any spread, noted that efforts to prevent the spread of the scourge ”is very minimal and only needs the willingness and diligence of a ‘commander.’” ”Rather than do the needful, he is attempting to control private trading. The same way this APC has fooled themselves by attempting to control house rents where they have indeed not provided any house as alternatives for residents,” the party said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
