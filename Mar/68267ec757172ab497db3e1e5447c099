As the global community intensifies its battle to contain the coronavirus pandemic, Osun State government on Saturday hinted that no fewer than 150 citizens of the state who are returnees from Cote d’Ivoire have been quarantined. The government contended that the development was part of the precautionary measures aimed at checkmating the spread of coronavirus disease considering the increasing infection rate in the country. This disclosure was made in Osogbo by the Osun State Commissioner for Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu while speaking with journalists. According to him, the state taskforce set up to contain the spread of coronavirus headed by the deputy governor was working round the clock to ensure that the state is safe and secure against the scourge of the dreaded coronavirus. While explaining that the only index case recorded in Osun was in stable condition, Isamotu said the state isolation centre located inside the State General Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo had been well equipped to handle challenges of the pandemic. He added that both serving and retired medical personnel in the state were collaborating with relevant stakeholders in tackling the spread of the disease.
