Speaking with the Nigerian Tribune, shortly after the inauguration and training workshop which held at NACGRAB Conference Hall, National Cereal Research Institute, Moor Plantation, Ibadan, Focal Person, KAFACI Nigeria, Dr Marcus Ogunbiyi, hinted that KAFACI is an intergovernmental organisation between South Korea and African countries currently in 19 African countries. “The major aim of the programme is to exchange ideas in order to improve agriculture in Africa.

We are particularly used to a particular type of armyworm. Unfortunately for some reasons, they are not popular anymore . But another variant and entirely new specie which is this new one, called armyworm, it has been around in a little way but we did not know it could be that devastating.” Professor Omoloye, submitted that the people of Nigeria should be grateful to KAFACI for coming up with the initiative targeted at bringing succour to maize farmers who have been experiencing series of difficulties due to the effect of armyworm. Also speaking with the Nigerian Tribune, Director, National Centre for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, Ibadan, Dr Sunday Ezekiel Aladele, said: ”We are very lucky to be given the opportunity to be supported by the Korean government through KAFACI to develop an improved food productivity in sub-saharan Africa, particularly Nigeria.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
