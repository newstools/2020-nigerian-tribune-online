The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), on Monday, said the commission in Kaduna state had introduced anti-corruption clubs in 48 secondary schools. Speaking with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna, Mr Godwin Basheru, the ICPC Principal Superintendent in charge of Education, said the aim of the anti-corruption clubs was to educate and enlighten youths on corruption. Basheru said the commission took the initiative because it considered youths, most of who are in secondary schools, as critical stakeholders in the fight against corruption. According to him, the anti-corruption clubs teach the youths how to handle corruption, to know the difference of right from wrong and to take the right decision when faced with corrupt individuals. Basheru said the commission had inaugurated 26 anti-corruption clubs in 11 schools in 2017, 5 in 2018, three in 2019 and three in 2020. He added that the commission resuscitated some anti-corruption clubs that had been abandoned in three secondary schools.
