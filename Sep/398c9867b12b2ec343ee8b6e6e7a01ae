Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has again reiterated his administration’s resolve to partner with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) for strict enforcement of road safety laws in the territory. He made this assurance while playing host to a delegation from the FRSC, led by the new Zone 7 Area Commander, Assistant Corps Marshal, Jonas Agwu, on a courtesy visit to his office in Abuja. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja, on Sunday, by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Anthony Ogunleye, the minister stressed the need for the Corps to massively deploy men and equipment to ensure enforcement of road safety laws on the roads Malam Bello commended him on his new post, urging him to place a lot of emphasis on the need for enforcement of traffic and road safety laws. According to him: “Enforcement is key. You have to massively deploy men and equipment on a very, very sustained level. Not just one week or two weeks but a sustained level, even if it takes months.” The minister said particular attention should be placed on the traffic congestion that occurs regularly at the Lugbe axis along the Airport Road especially in the evenings where unauthorised trading takes place usually under the pedestrian bridges.
