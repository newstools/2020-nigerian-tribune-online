MTN is adding its voice to global efforts to raise awareness about the importance of wearing masks to fight the spread of COVID-19 with its recent launch of the #WearItForMe campaign across its markets. As society navigates the “new normal” brought about by the pandemic, wearing face coverings remains one of the most effective measures to slow its spread. However, many people refuse to wear them, wear them incorrectly, or still underestimate their importance. “COVID-19 has had profound health and socioeconomic impacts across the world. We empathise and mourn the lives lost to the pandemic. And even though the outbreak appears to be slowing in Africa, now is not the time to be complacent,” MTN’s incoming group president and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ralph Mupita, said. “With increasing evidence that masks can limit the spread of COVID-19 and eventually eliminate the disease if worn by 80-90 per cent of the population, we need to do what we can to make a meaningful difference. Wearing a mask is not only about protecting oneself, but about respecting and protecting others,” Mupita added. To help drive this behaviour, MTN is committing its September 2020 marketing resources to encourage everyone to do more to save lives. #WearItForMe is the second phase of MTN’s Y’ello Hope COVID-19 response initiative. It is a powerful call-to-action using the voices of some of the most influential people in our communities — mothers and mother-figures. They will send heartfelt messages to all the children of Africa to wear a mask and “wear it for me.” The campaign will build on MTN’s work carried out under Y’ello Hope to brighten lives and limit the impact of the pandemic. .
