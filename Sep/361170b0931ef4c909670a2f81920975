AS Comrade Peter Onaja led-faction of the National Union of Food, Beverages and Tobacco Employees (NUFBTE), vowed to pursue their case at the National Industrial Court (NIC) when courts resume from vacation, the Comrade Lateef Oyelekan led-faction has stated that the union will abide by the judgement of the court, if it declared “null and void,” the emergence delegates conference earlier held and the two years extension given to the president and other officials of the union. The union has been divided into two factions following the emergency delegates conference held on Friday, August 21, 2020, where the tenure of the President, Comrade Oyelekan was extended for further two years after 12 years in office. The Comrade Onaja faction had approached court and alleged that the emergency delegates conference was held against court injunction, while the two years tenure extension was also given against the court order, which restrained the union from giving such tenure extension and holding the conference. But the Oyenekan faction said the union had not served the injunction and insisted that the emergency delegates conference held was constitutional and was held under the supervision of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). However, while reacting to the allegation, the Acting General Secretary of the union, Comrade Mike Olanrewaju, said those who were trading such allegations should go to court. He said: “supposing the injunction is properly served and we did not obey, it is clear, go back to court. When asked if the court should go ahead to declare the conference and the extension of tenure “null and void,” Comrade Olanrewaju said the union will  abide by the judgment. “Of course, we are Nigerians, we are law abiding people, we will,” he said, even as he insisted that there is no faction in the union.
