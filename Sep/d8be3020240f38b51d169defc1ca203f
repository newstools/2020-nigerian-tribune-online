SELECTED 40 local farmers in the Ilorin East/Ilorin South federal  constituency in Kwara state have been trained on how to reduce post harvest losses in their agricultural production. Speaking during official opening of the training programme at the Nigerian  Stored Products Research Institute (NSPRI) Ilorin, facilitator of the  programme and a member representing the federal constituency, Hon.   Abdulganiyu S. Cook Olododo, said one of the strategies to increase food  production is to empower farmers with skills, adding that such include modern ways of drying agricultural produce. “As part of revamping economic activities of my constituency and Kwara  State, increasing agricultural production and post harvest management would  be targeted for poverty alleviation, job creation,  food security and  improved livelihood. One of the failures of agricultural policies for  addressing developmental challenges in developing countries particularly  Nigeria is the lopsidedness of concentrating efforts on production at the  expense of post harvest activities. Yet, it is the agricultural activities  such as storage and small scale processing after harvest that involves  massive human engagement, which creates more small scale and family based  business.” Therefore, if agriculture is to be used for the development of  the state, effective post harvest management and value addition must be put  in a place to complement the agricultural production activities. This way,  agriculture will have direct bearing on the economic viability of the zone  and be beneficial to the nation”, he said.
