The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) and the Nigerian Railway Corporate (NRC) are seeking deeper collaboration in an attempt to end the gridlock currently been experienced around Nigeria’s ports. Speaking in Abuja, on Thursday, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Barrister Hassan Bello, stated that the digitalisation of shipping operations, as well as the deployment of the railway, were the solution to traffic gridlock been witnessed at the ports. “Three days ago, we had a meeting with NRC, NPA, the terminals where we strengthened the issue of the Standard Operating Procedures for rail. “The most important thing is to make sure ports are efficient because, if ports are efficient, then a lot of benefits will be accrued to the government and the entire Nigerians. Many sectors will say, I contributed a certain amount to the GDP and we want transport to also be contributing to the GDP,” Bello noted.

The Executive Secretary said NSC was engaging stakeholders in order to put in place safety measures for the return of normal operations within all ports in Nigeria.
