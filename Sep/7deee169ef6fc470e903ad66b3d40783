E Ink tablets are devices that allow you to do the things you can do with a pen and notepad, which is to take notes for keeps with the possibility of reviewing later. The simplicity of these devices is so amazing that using them is just like using pen and paper. Technological advancements have made lots of people turn to gadgets as note-taking tools. Many gadgets come with a stylus pen which makes it even easier to take notes but even with these gadgets, we still see pens and papers in use everywhere. Now, with the advent of E Ink, a lot of people are starting to do away with pen and paper because E Ink tablets give you a digital notepad that you can never exhaust with the look and feel of pen and paper. Some of these devices are even foldable. Cool right? E Ink tablets upload your written content to the cloud within seconds of writing so the page is available to be reused and your previous pages could be recalled from the cloud for revision. The battery of these devices also lasts much longer than traditional tablets as many of them can last for days.
