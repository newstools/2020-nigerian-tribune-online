Meanwhile, the lawmaker while addressing newsmen shortly after said that his decision to join the APC was as a result of the developmental strides of President Muhammadu Buhari, Gov. Abdullahi Sule and the speaker’s pragmatic and inclusive leadership. He added that the crisis in SDP currently was another reason for leaving the party. “First and foremost, I want to thank the leaders and supporters of my former party, SDP, for the support and mandate given to me as a member of the state legislature. “I was formerly a member of APC, but it was due to disagreement that I left the party to SDP. “What informed me to rejoin the party, APC, is as a result of the pragmatic leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, Gov. Abdullahi Sule as well as the outstanding performance and inclusive leadership of our speaker, Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi. “I want to join them to continue to contribute my quota to the development of my constituency, the state and the country at large. “My constituents have already given me approval and blessing to join the APC,” he said.
