The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday constituted a reconciliation committee headed by the Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, to resolve the crisis in the Ekiti State chapter of the party which has been embroiled in accusations and counter accusations leading to suspension galore in the party. The state chapter of the party had suspended 10 chieftains including Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Mr Babafemi Ojudu; Mr. Oyetunde Ojo and nine others following what it described as ‘anti-party activities.’ <IMG alt="" aspect-ratio=1.00 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" src="https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EKITI-360x360.jpg" srcset="https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EKITI-360x360.jpg 360w, https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EKITI-150x150.jpg 150w" width=360>Ojudu and the other party chieftains, in a swift reaction, also announced the suspension of Governor Kayode Fayemi, an action the governor described as a joke taken too far.
