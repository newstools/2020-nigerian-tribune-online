Police in Anambra State have arrested a 41-year-old man, one Ogbonna Nwankwo, for attempting to kill a 29-year-old woman, and cut off her breast at a motel in Ihite town, Orumba South Local Government Area of the state. The State Police PPRO, SP Haruna Mohammed, who disclosed this in a statement, said the incident happened on the 2/9/2020 at about 8 am, and that the duo involved reside in the same Ihite town. Mohammed said the suspect allegedly attempted to murder the lady inside the motel room by stabbing the victim with a knife in her stomach. He then tried to cut off her right side breast using the same knife probably for ritual purpose thinking she was dead before he was apprehended following her shout for help which attracted the attention of the motel manager. “Consequently, the scene was visited by police operatives attached to Umunze division and the victim rushed to specialist hospital Nnewi for treatment,” he said. He said the suspect who was seriously manhandled by an angry mob and beaten to stupor was then arrested by the police and taken to the hospital for treatment under police guard. Meanwhile, a blood-stained knife was recovered at the scene as an exhibit and the State Commissioner of Police, Mr John Abang, has directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department for discreet investigation in order to unravel the actual circumstances surrounding the incident.
