The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) International Headquarters, Onike, Yaba, Lagos and all its branches, zones and regions in Lagos and Ogun states will reopen for worship September 13. It would be recalled that the governments of both states had directed churches to open since August 9 and 16 respectively in both neighbouring states, after the national lockdown occasioned by the novel COVID-19 in March. In a release made available to Tribune Churchnews, the church authority stated that, the worship sessions at the International Headquarters of the church will hold its first service by 7:00-8:30 am; second service 9:30-11:00am and third service: 12pm-1:30pm. “Worshippers are expected to adhere to safety and prevention protocols of the use of face masks, hand wash and or the use of sanitizers and temperature checks. “Attendance of one session is sufficient for blessings. Worshippers at any of the services are expected to leave immediately to allow other worshippers for the next services,” the church leadership admonished. The Ministry further informed her viewers that the transmissions of her broadcasts on MFM Television and on all online platforms will also continue for the benefits of members and worshippers who were advised by the government to remain at home and countries where church services are yet to reopen. The MFM Ministries is happy to announce that the broadcasts on Lagos Television will also continue,” the statement read.
