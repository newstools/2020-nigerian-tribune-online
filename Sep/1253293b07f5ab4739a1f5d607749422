Travon Cosby, popularly known as B3ThaPlug, is a rapper and songwriter based in the United States of America. Over the years, B3 has understudied artistes like Young Thug, NBA, Gucci Mane, Youngboy and 50 Cent to mention but a few, and these hip hop heavyweights have influenced his brutal, legato and precise style of rap. Now, B3ThaPlug has announced that he will be dropping a new song this September with his return debut titled, ‘What It Cost Me’, a song that talks about the popsters’ journey, career challenges and personal life. In his bid to rebrand, he recently took down all his previous releases from the internet. He is also opening a new studio named ‘The Brick House Studio’. Speaking on his new effort and the studio, B3ThaPlug said, “I love music. It’s a getaway from all the pain and corruption in my life and also a very good income that keeps me busy. And there’s nothing better than to make money from something you love, that’s the reason I built my own studio. It’s also built for me to record my own art whenever I want to and also help artistes I have under my wing.
