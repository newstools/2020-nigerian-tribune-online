The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Monday, denied claims that the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Pipeline Project was inflated to the tune of $1.527billion. It described the allegations as false, baseless and unfounded. In a statement issued by its Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs, Dr Kennie Obateru, the Corporation said the allegation emanated from an analysis conducted by an Online medium. It explained that the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP)following a detailed review and analysis of the procurement bid, had confirmed that the unit costs for line pipes adopted by the NNPC for the project were reasonable when compared with current market prices for 40”, 36”, 20” and 14” steel pipes. It added that the BPP on this basis confirmed and granted a certificate of no objection dated August 11, 2017. NNPC stated that the AKK project underwent a transparent and open competitive tender process that resulted in the emergence of the most competitive bidders, wondering how a competitive tender process could be inflated.
