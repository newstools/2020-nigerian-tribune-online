Worried about terrorism financing and money laundering, as well as to make sure that Nigeria’s foreign exchange (forex) resources are properly tracked and used for the importation of priority goods, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has commenced closer investigations of over 100 companies and individuals over forex malpractices. Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, had in late August disclosed that the bank was determined to address the issue of forex non-repatriation in Nigeria. Also, as part of its effort to increase foreign exchange liquidity in the country, the CBN  directed all banks in the country to submit the names, addresses and Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) of exporters that have defaulted in repatriating their exports proceeds, for further action. The directive issued by the CBN governor, came barely 24 hours after the Bank announced the abolition of third-party “Form M” payment. The move by the CBN followed the adoption of the strategy to discourage over-invoicing, which some businesses have allegedly used to divert foreign exchange from the country, through the opening of “Forms M” for which payment is routed through a buying company, agent, or other third parties. Reports quoted banking sector sources as having said that the CBN is out to guard against terrorism funding and money laundering. “We are going to continue cracking down heavily on companies in the light of terrorism funding and money laundering. So, we want to make sure that all inflows and outflows are through the right channels,” the source stressed. He revealed that CBN has requested for all accounts (both Naira and foreign currency) of over 100 suspected companies, who specialise in buying forex from certain unauthorised sources without passing through the legitimate sources, thereby avoiding documentation and overheating the exchange rates.

Whereas CBN recognises that certain little payments of sums below $10,000 could be made for travels, school/boarding fees, subscription, fees, hospital bills among others with little or no documentation, the source said some unscrupulous companies had hidden under this guise to illegally transfer/repatriate huge sums of forex out of the country without following laid down rules and regulations of CBN. The source also revealed that some unscrupulous companies use this guise to conduct export activities on what is regarded as open accounts without completing NXP forms before conducting their export activities thereby avoiding repatriating the forex back to the country through approved and recognised channels. These illegal exporters, he stated, are known to compromise officials of shipping lines and companies, who turn blind eyes by not demanding for NXP form numbers. According to him, CBN and customs have always insisted that for any export activity to be conducted, NXP numbers must be stated on all export documents to the shipping companies but the shipping lines have failed in making such requests from the illegal exporters. “There are also cases where some blatantly go to the BDCs to buy huge dollar cash, deposit them in banks, and resort to transfer of such funds for such unauthorised transactions without documentation using the online medium usually regarded as Straight Through Processing (STP),” he explained, adding: “CBN insists that all forex transactions must pass through the I&E window and the banks to provide full visibility, hence the reason for the ongoing investigations to stop these forex malpractices.” Some individuals whose accounts are being scrutinised include Mr Okechukwu Ezeh, Mr Adamu Ezeh and Mr Adebutu Bankole. Furthermore, CBN is also investigating the bank accounts of Haitch & Elf Integrated Services Limited, Fenog Nigeria Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Hartford Resources Nigeria Limited, Don & Chyke Nigeria Limited, BCL Trading Services Limited, and Omniworx Export Enterprises. Aioon Energy Limited, Cowry Assets Management Limited, Everdon Nigeria Limited, Caml Bureau De Change and Everdon Bureau De Change are also listed.
