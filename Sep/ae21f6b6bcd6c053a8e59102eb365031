In spite of the scathing criticisms trailing the hike in the price of petroleum and electricity tariff, the governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have commended President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking under the aegis of the Progressive Governors Forum, the APC governors said the present administration has seized the initiative to fast track the economy. Kebbi State governor and chairman of the PGF,  Abubakar Atiku Bagudu in a statement noted that the revival of the railways, the second Niger Bridge and move to resuscitate the moribund Ajaokuta Steel are indicators of efficient management of the economy. The statement further commended the recent judgement of Justice Rose Cranston of the Royal Courts of Justice Strand, London which ordered a stay of execution of penalty against Nigeria in respect of the $9.6 billion Process and Industrial Development (P&ID) debt judgement.
