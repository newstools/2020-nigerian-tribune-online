The Academic Staff Union of Universities, (ASUU), Nsukka Zone on Friday warned that plans to reopen universities now are a Pandora box to the second wave of COVID-19. The Zonal Coordinator, Dr Igbana Ajjr who stated this during a press conference held at Chateau De Victoria Hotel, Makurdi also debunked the belief in some quarters that ASUU embarked on strike as a result of Integrated Payroll and Personal Information. Dr Ajir said that following the guidelines established by the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19, the government should address adequate hostel accommodation, availability of physical facilities to enable social distancing in large and crowded classrooms, running water, steady source of power, testing and isolation centres.
