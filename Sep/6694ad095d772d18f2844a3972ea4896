The Shipping Correspondents Association of Nigeria (SCAN) has tasked government agencies at the ports to tackle the incessant Peak Season Surcharge (PSS) being slammed on Nigerian bound cargoes by foreign shipping lines. This is even as the group called for the disbursement of the Cabotage Vessel Finance Fund (CVFF), and also called for a lasting solution to the absence of scanners at Nigerian ports. In a statement signed by SCAN President, Yusuf Babalola, the group also lauded the recent synergy among the heads of Nigeria’s maritime agencies aimed at eliminating friction among government agencies while discharging their duties. According to the statement, “As the pandemic eases off, SCAN wishes to urge the Federal Government to quit lip service and deliver on its several promises to put the maritime sector in the right condition to enable it perform optimally as the backbone of the nation’s economy. “Issues like the recent Peak Season Surcharge (PSS) unilaterally slammed on Nigerian bound cargoes by shipping agencies, disbursements of the CVFF, issue of indigenous vessel ownership, provision of scanners are all begging for prompt attention at the ports.” The group also noted that, “with the nation’s huge cargo advantage, it should be able to not only retain the huge expenses on patronage of foreign vessels but also significantly dictate how its shipping affairs are run. “The presidency and heads of maritime agencies must also end the entrenched corruption on the port roads.” Recall that the heads of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA); Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA); Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC); Nigeria Customs Service (NCS); Maritime Academy of Nigeria (MAN); and the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) recently began a periodic meeting to harmonise operations.

But something tells me it won’t be the last. There is the feeling today in power circles that because of the ascendancy of the Internet and its platforms of social engagements, the press as we knew it is now impotent and could be humiliated and called stupid without consequences. The truth of the media’s undying powers should be clear in what Femi just went through… Buhari Approves Transfer Of NIMC To Communications Ministry President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the transfer of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy.
