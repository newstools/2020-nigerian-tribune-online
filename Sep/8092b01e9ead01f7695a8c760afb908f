The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has announced that Rivers State and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) take the lead among states with food insecurity in the country. The Bureau said this in a survey report entitled: ‘The Impact of COVID-19 in Kano, Lagos, Rivers, and FCT Abuja’. The report is the outcome of the second quarter,2020 Labor Force Survey, carried out by the World Bank Poverty Team in the month of August In the summary of its report, the National Bureau of statistics said “the second quarter (Q2) 2020 Labor Force Survey (LFS) – collected by the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) between the 17th June and 8th July 2020 – provides crucial information on households’ response to COVID-19 in the key states of Kano, Lagos, Rivers, and FCT Abuja, which can be benchmarked against pre-crisis data from the 2018/19 Nigerian Living Standards Survey (NLSS). Several key insights emerge from this analysis: “The share of people engaged in economic activities in the four states was lower in June/July 2020 than before the COVID-19 crisis, especially in FCT Abuja where the share of people working was down by around 14 percentage points.
