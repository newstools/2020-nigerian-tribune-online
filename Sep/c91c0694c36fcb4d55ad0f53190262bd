The escapee was said to be on top speed along the busy old road inside the town before he ran into the victims, killing them on the spot. The owner of the stolen car, one Martin narrated that ” I was trying to look for one or two passengers to Asaba, as I used to do before, leaving the key in the ignition when the suspect quickly entered the car and zoomed off. “Before I could know what was happening, somebody just jumped inside the car and immediately drove away, so, I stopped Okada and gave him a hot chase. “The man was on speed trying to escape before he ran into Okada man who carried a pregnant woman and they died on the spot. When we got to the scene, I found out that the suspect is Fulani man. “As people came to the scene and saw that the pregnant woman and the Okada rider were already dead, they pounced on him before the police came and rescued him.” The suspect was said to have been rushed to one of the nearby hospitals for treatment. When contacted on Monday, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya toldTribune Online that she was yet to get details from Issele-Uku divisional police station.
