The world for the first time is at the warfront, fighting not countries against one another but a common deadly enemy which has almost claimed the global territory before measures are put in place, even religion and reasonable health sector are still incapable of an antidote to end the ravaging pandemic in the human world while the most acclaimed economy world power countries are struggling against the alien disease which has forced the global economy from physical reach to a digital world which positions each nation according to their various capacity in times of technology usage. Many companies work from home and several organisations which didn’t have appropriate measures to cope with the situation closed down their dealings till reasonable solutions will be achievable. The United Nations Organization is facing the test of its life after averting World War III, no situation has ever held the entire globe to ransom as COVID-19 did, the World Health Organisation is trying every possible means to produce a vaccine for the virus but none is yet to materialize. The pandemic will leave behind a new world in which humans will be forced to live with it and this could be demanding and difficult to do but choices are not many; using of face masks in public places like markets, banks and religious gatherings will be the business of the day, washing of hands regularly and personal hygiene activities must be prioritized while social distancing will continue in any human assembly. Many countries have suffered economically both internally and externally, values of commodities which many countries see as the source of incomes have drastically reduced leaving many firms with little option than to sack workers leaving many citizen jobless, many countries are now relying on loan to carry out their day-to-day governmental activities, some nations are in a master-to-servant relationship due to the scar of COVID-19. When the volume of the whole issue is tuned down, we will have a new world which will be strange to the one we had before, governments of all countries will now realize that health comes first in any agenda they are planning; building good and standard hospitals with qualified workers will be the business of the day, many countries before the pandemic gave little attention to health care, hospitals are filled with outdated and unqualified workers which positions the citizens at the losing end. Many governments should now realize that reservoir of resources is good for any government that has the love of her citizen because it bails in times of struggles and rescues the nation in a stranded situation like this, during the complete lockdown many developed countries gave reasonable palliatives to their citizens to help them meet the minimum necessity while at home and this was sponsored from the reserved fund of the nation together with the help of some philanthropists, there are countries which can’t achieve this ground due to improvident and mismanagement on the part of their leaders Some people believe technology will make the world smaller and make life easier, while some set of people see it as smaller without technology, the amount of assistance technologies is rendering in this trial time can’t be overlooked, it gives hope and prevent wide spread of the disease, it helps information to move faster and routed to the necessary places for proactive measures to be put in place.
