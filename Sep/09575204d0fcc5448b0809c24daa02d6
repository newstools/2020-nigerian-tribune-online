The Senior Pastor of Christ Apostolic Church (Oke Ayo),  Iseyin, Oyo State, Pastor Paul Aderoju, has admonished Christians to rejoice always, pray without ceasing and give thanks to God in everything during this pandemic. Aderoju made the call  during his sermon at the  26th anniversary and annual convention of the church,  held at the church auditorium. The cleric said rejoicing in God is the only solution to the pandemic as well as the  only way to overcome other socio-economic and political problems in the country. He noted with dismay that events all over the world since March regarding the  pandemic have done more harm, calling on people to be fervent in their prayers. The cleric, who said if ‘there is life, there is hope’, admonished people to give thanks to God in everything. “Nigeria belongs to God who knows the end and the beginning. Whatever happens God will continue to remain God because He is irreplaceable” he added. He also enjoined the Federal Government to put in place more palliative programmes to assist the masses. The cleric equally appealed to Christians to always observe COVID-19 protocols in their respective churches, just as he charged Nigerians to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and saviour.
