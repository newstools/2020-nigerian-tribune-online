The local bourse remained positive after the day’s session, on Wednesday, to close the month of September with 0.9 per cent appreciation in the equities market indicators. Specifically, the All-Share Index (ASI) of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) advanced by 0.85 per cent to settle at 26,831.76 basis points amid sustained bargain hunting activity even as the Exchange recorded 20 gainers as against eight losers at the close of the trading session. Accordingly, the Month-to-Date gain increased to 5.9 per cent while the Year-to-Date loss was marginal at 0.02 per cent, as interest in the stocks of Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria and Guaranty Trust Bank contributed largely to the positive trading session, after their shares gained 2.8 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively.
