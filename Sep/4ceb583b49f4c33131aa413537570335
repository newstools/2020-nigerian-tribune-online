A group under the auspices of “Benue Youth Forum’ on Wednesday called on the National Assembly to reject the Water Resources Bill. President of the organisation, Terrence Kuanum, made the call during a press conference in Makurdi, Benue State capital. Kuanum called on Nigerians to rise and resist what he described as “the devilishly land-grabbing bill intended to convert water and river banks for the use of Fulani cows.” The group leader threatened that any attempt to pass the bill which he described as ‘obnoxious’ will be greeted with spontaneous negative reactions across the country.

We advise that the Buhari administration should allow the people to have their way. “The National Water Resources Bill is a well-orchestrated plot to turn Nigerians to slaves in their own country. On the allegation that Governor Samuel Ortom had chased Fulani herdsmen away from Benue to promote his own cattle business, Kuanum said the allegation was senseless and absurd,  stressing, “nothing could be farther from the truth.” He urged Nigerians to ignore the smear campaign orchestrated by Middle Belt Conscience Group against Governor Ortom for challenging the “obnoxious National Resources Water Bill.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE FROM QUICK RELEASE AND SMALL CUCUMBER,  I NOW DRILL MADAM WELLA IN ZA OTHER ROOM TILL SHE CRIES TEARS  OF JOY.
