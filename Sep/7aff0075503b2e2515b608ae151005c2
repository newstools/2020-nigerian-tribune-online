Ahead of the proposed amendment of the 1999 Constitution by the Senate ad-hoc committee led by Senator Ovie Omo Agege, the Middle Belt Congress has submitted a memorandum to the Committee. Investigation revealed that the MBC is seeking for the creation of an additional 19 states in the country to make the total number of states to 55. The 55 states would, however, be subordinated to 12 Provinces which the MBC envisaged would serve as the new federating units. The new 55 states according to the MBC proposal would supervise new municipalities to serve as the third tier of government as they demanded the abolition of the 774 local councils in the existing 1999 Constitution. Tribune Online checks further revealed that aside from the MBC, 49 other groups have since submitted memoranda to the Constitution Review Committee. The MBC memorandum reads in part: “That there shall be only two tiers of government in Nigeria – the Federal Government and the federating units as sub-national Governments. “Local Governments councils should no longer function as the third tier of government but as administrative units of the sub-national governments. “The former LGs should be renamed ‘Councils’ or ‘Municipalities’ or ‘Development Areas’ or ‘Burroughs’ or any other names Nigerians might prefer.
