Aside from professors, you can consult guidance counselors in the institution, or your trusted colleagues in school, emphasis on ‘Trusted.’ For any collegian, time is an essential resource that you cannot take lightly. Plan your time early on, preferably within the first few weeks of learning after you have become settled. Are you the type of student who often finds themselves asking, “I need someone to write my paper for me?” It could be due to a lack of time management skills. So, create your time for studying, assignments as well as rest and any other extra-curricular activities. Getting used to time management early on will help you even in the future.

Take the opportunity to forge good relationships with your peers. Make friends among your classmate, sororities, fraternities, and even in the clubs and student organizations. Your professors are also essential people to keep in touch with. Professors usually have a lot of networks themselves, from former students and even employers in the outside world. You can even consult the alumni board for contact with individuals already pursuing careers in your course. Remember that who you are in college is what your colleagues/connections remember when you connect in the future, for professional reasons. So, preserve your image while in college.
