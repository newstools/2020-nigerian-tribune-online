According to the statement: “As a friend and partner of Nigeria, we are closely following the lead up to the off-cycle governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States scheduled for September 19 and October 10 respectively. “These elections are important both as an essential element of effective governance within both states and an indicator of the strength of Nigeria’s democratic institutions.

The discussions focused on the need for the parties’ leaders to prevail on supporters to avoid violence before and after the elections and we welcome the Edo candidates’ signature of the National Peace Committee and INEC convened peace accord today. “We will be deploying observation missions to both the Edo and Ondo elections and supporting civil society led observation. The UK takes a strong stand against election-related violence and, just as we did in the general election in 2019, will continue to take actions against individuals we identify as being responsible for violence during the elections. “This could include restrictions on their eligibility to travel to the UK, restriction on access to UK based assets or prosecution under international law. “The UK will continue to provide support and engagement as we move towards these elections. We urge INEC, the police and all other agencies involved to work together to deliver free, fair and credible elections.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
