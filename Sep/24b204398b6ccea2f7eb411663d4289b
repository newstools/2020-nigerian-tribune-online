Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has approved the immediate payment of special productivity bonus for all categories of health workers in the state public service. Mr Kunle Somorin, Chief Press Secretary to the governor, said this in a statement on Friday, in Abeokuta. Somorin said the bonus, which was a one-time payment was applicable to all health workers in the state who were on active service as at the end of August. According to him, it is in recognition of the understanding, maturity, and dedication with which they continued to discharge their duties and responsibilities. “The bonus will be calculated as 10 per cent of the respective monthly gross pay of the beneficiaries. “We are proud that the vast majority of our Ogun health workers place service to the citizens over and above any other consideration, even as they continue to draw government’s attention to issues that affect their own welfare and working conditions.
