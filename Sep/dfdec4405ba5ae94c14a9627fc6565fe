He also expressed good wishes for greater achievements in the years ahead for the West African country. President Buhari said: ‘‘I feel delighted because this is my first official visit to Guinea Bissau since my assumption of office in 2015 and because I am here to join you, brotherly people of Guinea Bissau, as you celebrate this great day with renewed hope and aspiration. ‘‘I am truly grateful for the warm reception accorded me and my delegation, since our arrival in this city. ‘‘As you mark your freedom as a nation “free forever’, let me seize this opportunity to salute all Bissau Guineans both at home as well as in the Diaspora, for the strides you have made as a country. Permit me to say Parabens! Congratulations!’’ President Buhari recounted that on September 10, 1974, Guinea Bissau declared its independence from Portugal, after a protracted struggle for freedom, which brought Portuguese colonization to an end. ‘‘It is fitting on this august occasion to remember your forebears and to celebrate them for the sacrifices they made for you to be free. ‘‘The highest tribute we can pay them is to build on the gains of independence. It is my sincere prayer that your country will continue on the path of national cohesion, growth and unity,’’ he said. On the return to democracy in the West African country, President Buhari noted that in the aftermath of the peaceful presidential elections in 2019, which ushered in the present administration of President Embalo, Guinea Bissau had a great opportunity to unleash the great economic potential of this country. ‘‘The international community attested to the fairness of the elections now endorsed by the Supreme Court of Guinea Bissau. ‘‘I, therefore, congratulate you, the people of Guinea-Bissau for this achievement and urge you to sustain your unity of purpose,’’ he said. President Buhari also used the occasion to reflect on the excellent relations between Nigeria and Guinea, pledging that his administration will take it to a new height. ‘‘Relations between Nigeria and the Republic of Guinea Bissau which dates back to the country’s liberation struggle against Portugal have been extremely warm. ‘‘I am determined to carry this excellent relationship to the next level of fruitful cooperation and partnership, together with my brother Umaro Embalo,’’ he said.
