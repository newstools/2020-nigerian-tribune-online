My 15- year old daughter was raped while in school. Unfortunately, she only informed one week after the incident when she developed abdominal pain from the trauma of the incident. Kindly let me know what to do to treat her. Sadiat (by SMS)  The standard protocol for managing rape victims include, a report to the police for a police report, medical attention for treatment and issuance of a medical report to be followed by the identification and prosecution of the rapist. It is important for all these to be carried out within 48 hours of the incident in order to preserve the evidences of the crime. Even though one week after the incident appears very late, you can still proceed with the established protocol. YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
