Investigation is yet to commence on the cause of the reported case of collision between a passenger aircraft belonging to the Middle East Airline and a Turkish plane at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. Speaking with the Tribune Online on the phone, the public affairs manager of the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), the government agency responsible for investigating accidents and incidents, Mr Tunji Oketumbi, said the bureau was yet to commence investigation as it was making efforts to determine what transpired and the level of the accident or incident. According to Oketumbi, if the level of the collision did not cause deep damage to the aircraft to the extent that it cannot fly, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority may handle the issue.
