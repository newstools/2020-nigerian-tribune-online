Medical doctors in  Ondo State under the auspices of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP) at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) have withdrawn their services and stopped attending to patients admitted at the centre. Disclosing this on Monday, the State Secretary of NAGGMDP, Dr Olasakinju Tunde, said the doctors decided to withdraw their service following the failure of the state government to accede to their demands. According to the statement, “We had through the Congress requested that our members who are the COVID19 specialists in the Infectious Disease Hospital Akure to continue to work till Thursday morning, 2nd July 2020 in the interest of the general public and particularly confirmation of the COVID19 Status of Mr Governor.
