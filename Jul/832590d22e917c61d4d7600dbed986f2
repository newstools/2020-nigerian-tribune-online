Secretary of the Caretaker Committee of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, Mr Diran Odeyemi, has assured members of the party that the remaining congresses in the state will be concluded democratically if the ongoing reconciliation effort fails. According to Odeyemi, a letter suggesting the earliest conclusion of local and state executive committee had already been sent to the National Chairman so as to avoid an extension of the Caretaker Committee beyond the 90 days mandate. Odeyemi pointed out that the state caretaker committee, like every other State Executive Committee of the PDP, is not mandated to conduct elections but can only assist officials assigned to do so by the office of the National Organising Secretary of the party at the appropriate time.

On March 7, 2020, Ward Congress, Odeyemi said there was no ambiguity in the National Working Committee (NWC) position as communicated in its letter of April 25, 2020, containing names of Ward Executive Committee members for 155 out of the 177 wards in the State. He said without prejudice to the existing court matter, the elected Ward Executive Committee of the 155 wards have since assumed office. The Caretaker Committee Secretary called on members of the party to remain calm, saying the NWC will do the needful concerning the Local Government and State Congresses at the appropriate time.
