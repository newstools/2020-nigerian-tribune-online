Worried by the horrendous revelations emanating from the investigations by the National Assembly in the affairs of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), the Urhobo Leadership Forum, Abuja has called for the prosecution of all those involved in the financial embezzlement and misappropriation of the funds of the Commission. President of the Forum, Olorogun Jonathan Esin, who made the call on Monday while addressing a press conference in Abuja said, in order to bring the rot and looting in the NDDC to an end and reposition it for effective delivery on its statutory responsibilities, sensitive positions in the Commission should not be given to active political actors. The Forum, according to its president said audited accounts and reports of the NDDC should be undertaken and made available to the public as provided in the enabling Act, even as it called on the Federal Government to strengthen the Commission’s financial management and internal control system.

While kicking against the scrapping of the NDDC, the Forum said, such an action will create its own problems, “Therefore, the matter should be handled with seriousness, equity and justice that the situation demands so that there is no relapse or degeneration into destructive militancy that predated the establishment of the NDDC”. The Forum called on governors of the Niger Delta States to be more alive to their responsibilities of advising the NDDC Board and monitoring the activities of the Commission for the equitable development of the Niger Delta area as stipulated in the enabling Act. The Urhobo Leadership Forum faulted the setting up an Interim Management Committee to run the affairs of the NDDC, while the nominated Board members, cleared by the Senate have been on standby since last year without being inaugurated to assume responsibilities.
