The Oniru of Iru Kingdom, Oba Gbolahan Lawal, on Monday, reiterated his stance against any form of violence, lawlessness and recourse to self-help, warning palace officials to remain emotionally stable in the discharge of their duties, even in the face of provocation. The monarch said this in a statement made available to newsmen in Lagos, sequel to an incident which culminated in an altercation between some officials of the Oniru’s palace and a group led by one Prince Tijani Oniru. Meanwhile, the Oniru has ordered the suspension of the palace official involved in the incident pending further investigation by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Area J and the Area Commander, even as he enjoined all parties to desists from all forms of violence but rather should uphold peace, law and order. Reports of the ugly incident, which occurred within the Oniru Estate neighbourhood close to Millennium Estate gates, had it that the team of palace officials led by one Prince Murisiku Ajasa was allegedly accosted by the said Prince Tijani Oniru and some other persons, while the palace officials were on a routine inspection to supervise work being done by an inventory and enumeration group from the palace.

The statement, while noting that the monarch had ordered the suspension of the officers involved in the incident pending further investigation by the DPO of Area J and the Police Area Commander (PAC), enjoined all parties to desists from all forms of violence but rather should uphold peace, law and order. “Notwithstanding the provocative affront to the authority of the Oniru and desecration of tradition, the Oniru warned palace officials to remain emotionally stable in the discharge of their duties, even in the face of provocation. “In addition, he sees no reason or excuse for violence in Iru Land.
