His campaigns will be showcasing excellent governance and unmatched leadership positives. Obaseki has given a good account of himself on the back of the massive infrastructure transformation, education, healthcare, judicial and investment reforms, sustained efforts to evolve an industrial economy and a searing commitment to improving the wellbeing of Edo people. “Obaseki’s popularity is unrivalled; we are accepted by our people from the villages to the urban centres. The acceptance is resounding and deafening and comes September 19, 2020 the governor will be reelected for a second term in office to consolidate on his people-oriented projects and reforms.” Osagie further urged youths in the state not to allow themselves to be used as tools to perpetuate any act of electoral malpractice.
