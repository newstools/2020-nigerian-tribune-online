Before the chicken came home to roost in Ghana through the recent embassy demolition, it berthed in South Africa through the xenophobia highway en route China, through racial profiling avenue via corona aftermath with a constant denominator, lack of synergy between Nigerians abroad and their embassies. The event in Indonesia capped up a miserable stunt; destroying embassy property, this is akin to felony and this calls for concern. An embassy should be the citizen’s shield against oppression and these incidents are poignant reminders of something gory and distasteful in act and in deed. On both spectra; foreigners and citizens, this must be corrected through constructive engagement because the same resentment that followed perceived neglect at home and sent our youths abroad to hustle has turned some citizens against the flag, making it easy for other countries to surreptitiously humiliate Nigeria. Until we flex our muscles for impact and they will soft pedal, out of respect because it’s believed that charity begins at home. We should also create a code of conduct akin to the ease of doing business for our embassies to upgrade their services according to international best practices. If there’s no gaping hole in the wall, there will be no space for an itinerant lizard. Let’s make our embassies a home away from home and reduce unwarranted assaults on our goodwill and integrity because a word is enough for the wise. A child that’s neglected by the village will help to burn down the village to get the required warmth.
