Britain is set to announce measures to promote youth employment and stimulate the housing market on Wednesday, as it braces for the severe economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce a job scheme for people aged between 16 and 24, and reduce tax on house sales. Sunak also pledged some 3 billion pounds (3.8 billion dollars) for improving energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. Recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to spend 5 billion pounds on infrastructure projects and launch a 12-billion-pound house-building programme to kick-start Britain’s economic recovery.
