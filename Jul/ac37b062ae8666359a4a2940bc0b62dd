The acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, is currently being grilled by a panel set up to investigate alleged infractions against him. The panel is sitting at the Conference Centre of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. However, journalists who had arrived to cover the event at about 3.20 pm, were denied access by security personnel. “They said you people should excuse the use of this place for today,” a security official detailed to the venue, politely told reporters. Magu was said to have been arrested by the Department of State Security (DSS), in Abuja, on Monday. He was said to have been stopped in traffic while moving out of the Wuse II Annex of the EFCC in Abuja and the invitation was extended to him. This followed allegations that he owns four properties and was allegedly transferring funds abroad through a third party. In an official statement by the Public Relations Officer, Department of State Services, Peter Afunanya, he said Magu was not arrested by DSS. “The Department of State Services (DSS) wishes to inform the public that it did not arrest Ibrahim Magu, Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as has been reported by sections of the media. The Service, has since, today, July 6th 2020, been inundated with enquiries over the alleged arrest.” Another report said the agents who arrested him are from Force CID.
