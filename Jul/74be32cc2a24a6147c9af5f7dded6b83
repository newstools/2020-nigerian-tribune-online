Following some technical challenges facing Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19, testing centre in Ebonyi State has been closed down. Commissioner for Health, Dr. Daniel Umezurike, made this known during a review meeting on the approach adopted by the state government in the fight against COVID-19 held at the Deputy Governor’s Office on Wednesday. According to Umezurike, Governor David Umahi gave the order so as to attend to the challenges through a comprehensive servicing of the equipment and to inject more equipment to upgrade the services of the lab. Umezurike added that the servicing had commenced, maintaining that the lab would commence full activity by next week. He however disclosed that the state was planning to commence house to house active case search as the pandemic has reached community transmission stage. “I also want to inform you that we have little challenges in the lab that the governor directed for a temporary shutdown for us to have a comprehensive servicing of the equipment and also to inject more equipment to upgrade the services of the lab, because lab is very strategic in the management of COVID-19. “It is a disease you cannot manage blindfolded, because there are so many other symptoms that resemble it, so you must be able to say, laboratory wise, that this person is tested and he is positive or not. Qaulity assurance is very important and that is what we are doing. “They have started the servicing over the weekend, but they have not completed it. So, within this week, it will be completed and by next week, full activity will also recommence in the lab,”the commissioner said.
