The country has recently lifted a partial night curfew it imposed over the past three months and reopened restaurants, cafes, theatres and cinemas as well as hotels, museums and archaeological sites for tourists, all with limited capacity. Egypt and China have been cooperating closely in fighting the pandemic through exchanging medical aid and expertise. In February, Egypt provided aid to China to help with its fight against COVID-19 and China later returned the favour by sending three batches of medical aid to the North African country, the latest of which was in mid-May. Since mid-April, Chinese doctors and medical experts have held three video conferences with Egyptian counterparts to share their experience in the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus.
