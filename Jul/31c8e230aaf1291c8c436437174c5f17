CONTINUE FROM LAST WEEK THE individual complaint mechanism is designed so that an individual woman, or a group of women, who feel that her/their rights have been abused can submit the details of the discrimination to a committee of experts which will review the case. Traces of DNA from blood, hair, skin,vagina epithelial cells, saliva, semen, teeth bite can be quickly obtained to aid corroborative evidence. This can be useful in Corroborating evidence in cases of sexual assault through medical evidence. The legal requirement of eye witness evidence to corroborate rape cases and the lack of human and material resources to medically investigate and reach conclusive findings in a rape case leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Section 282 of the Northern Nigeria Penal Code and Section 357 of the Criminal Code also exempts perpetrators of rape within marriage from punishment. Also the Criminal code states that rape is only on women, any person can be raped. The Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPPA) seems like a very progressive piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the law is only applicable in the FCT, Abuja. It does not apply in the other States of the Federation. This also should be looked into.

Schools should start teaching children how to speak up against unusual friendly behaviors of people they are in care of they should scream to call for help against sex offenders. Myths such as having sex with a child or virgin to cure diseases should be made known to people as false. Victim blaming for being the reason why they were raped should be jettisoned. Such ideas as dressing provocatively or flirtatious acts as reasons why victims were raped should be frowned upon. Victim should not be blamed for an offender’s crime. 11.The Legislature and law enforcement agencies should ensure that anyone found to have abetted the commission of rape or is an accomplice of a sex offender should be made guilty of the act itself. Same gesture should be extended to anyone that procures the rape of another.Ignorance of the age of the girls as regards consent should no longer be a ground for defense of rape Article by Barr Chioma Mary Ebubedike Igbokwe Mary & Jane Stephen & Associates  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Naaba, Utomi, Sani, Yunusa, Sonaya, Others Meet Over New Political Front Monday Driving towards its agenda of launching a new political movement by January 2021, conveners and members of the National Consultative Front (NCF) will meet on Monday… Read Full Story MONDAY LINES” When Òsómàáló Buys Coronavirus I am an Oyo-Yoruba and I know that my ancestors have several pejorative terms to describe the Ijesa.
