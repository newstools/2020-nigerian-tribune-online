I wish to use this medium to reach the Oyo State government and the Federal Government of Nigeria in relation to the condition of my community, Alaro, Ibadan. We are faced with serious security issues in this area. Although the landlords association of the area led by the chairman, Mr Waidi Olasunkanmi, in collaboration with other landlords and landladies is trying to ensure the area is safe and peaceful, some troublemakers have continued to terrorise the area.
