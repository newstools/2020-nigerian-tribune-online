He also disclosed that the state government has​ established COVID-19 testing laboratory at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital (COOUTH) and it has started functioning. “The lab became operational last week. Already, the laboratory has run a total of 208 Covid-19 tests within its short period of operation. Each of its five machines has an installed capacity to run 470 tests in 24 hours. This means that when fully optimised, our molecular laboratory can run a total of 2,350 Covid-19 tests in 24 hours. That is very impressive by all standards. With this new capacity, we are finally ready to take the battle to COVID-19 in Anambra State.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
