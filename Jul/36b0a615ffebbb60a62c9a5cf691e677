I extend our sympathy to the bereaved families and the whole humanitarian community in Nigeria. “This incident once more underlines the huge sacrifices being made by humanitarian workers who work alongside this Ministry to see that the vulnerable populations are given succour. “In spite of this setback, I would like to assure all humanitarian workers in Nigeria that this Ministry will continue to assist in ensuring that the lives of humanitarian workers are protected in line with International Humanitarian Law, and by interfacing between the Nigerian security agencies and the humanitarian workers rendering lifesaving assistance in Nigeria. May the souls of the departed aid workers rest in peace, Amen.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
