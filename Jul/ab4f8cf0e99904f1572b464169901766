AGF Abdulrazaq (SAN)”, a condolence message personally signed by the Speaker said. “Baba’s demise is not a loss for Abdulrazaq’s family, but to the entirety of Kwarans and Nigerians at large, given his monumental sacrifices and commitment to the socio-economic and political development of the State and country, in his personal, professional and political capacity.
