The Federal Government has expressed commitment to the reduction of out-of-school children from the current 10.2 million to 5 million by the year 2023 and called on the World Bank to support the country in actualising the set target. Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu who made the call, said the goal of the current administration was to ensure that Nigerian children have access to qualitative education, irrespective of their economic backgrounds. Director, Press and Public Relations, Mr Ben Bem Goong, in a statement, on Wednesday in Abuja, said Adamu spoke when a delegation of the World Bank, led by its Country Director, Mr Shubham Chawdry, paid him a working visit. The Minister, who expressed discomfort at the number of out-of-school children in the country, said that the Federal Government was keen on reducing the number in addition to improving the standard of education in the country.
