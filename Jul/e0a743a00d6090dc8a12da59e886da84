The management of Nigerian Breweries Plc has debunked  claims,  making the rounds that it had decided to rest the very popular Golden Pen Award, a reward initiative, designed by the company for the nation’s media practitioners. Making the clarification, in Lagos, recently, at the flag-off of this year’s Maltina Teacher of The Year  (MToY) Award, the company’s Head, Sustainability and Regulatory  Relations, Mr. Patrick Olowokere, stated that though the Golden Pen Award had not held in the past two years, the management was not planning to rest it permanently, but rather to reposition it. According to him, one of the ways it intended to refresh the Award was to incorporate  other sections of the media, such as the online, so as to make the Award  more vibrant and competitive. “We held the Award for ten years. And what we normally do in Nigerian Breweries is to evaluate our programmes, after some certain periods,  with the aim of making them better. That is what we’ve done in the case of the Golden Pen Award,” he stated. While flagging off the MToY Award, the compamy’s Corporate Affairs Director,  Sade Morgan, explained that the Award was specifically designed to recognise and honour the nation’s teachers both in the public and private secondary schools. She added that the advent of Coronavirus pandemic had made this year’s Award more significant, since it had brought out the resilience in the Nigerian teachers. According to her, the competition which runs between now and October, this year, would see the best three winners, recognised at the grand finale of the Award, expected to hold in Lagos, in October, this year. The winner of the Award is expected to go home with  a total of N6.5million.
