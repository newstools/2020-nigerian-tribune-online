The Nation of July 16 reported suspended acting EFCC boss Magu to have said, “What I have gone through is a case of dog eats [sic] dog.” In July 8, I said of the Malami/Magu fight: “I have no dog in the dog-eat-dog food fight between two dogged scammers.” I’m glad Magu agrees with me that he’s a “dog” that another “dog” is eating. In other words, he isn’t innocent. He is himself a dog that eats other dogs but whom a bigger dog is now eating. In a dog-eat-dog world, dogs do whatever it takes to get the upper hand. Malami is now the top dog. Magu is the underdog. But they’re both bad dogs. Dog-tired Nigerians are asking the same question that the Baha Men asked years ago: who let the dogs out?
