The appointment of Dr Samuel Ogundiran as the Chairman of the Governing Council of the Ibarapa Polytechnic, Eruwa, by the Oyo State government is already raising dust within the school community over allegations of financial misconduct during his first spell as chairman of the council of which according to stakeholders still hanging on his neck. Ogundiran, who was Governing Council Chairman of the institution under the late Senator Abiola Ajimobi-led administration in Oyo State, was arrested by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Ibadan, on Tuesday, May 28, 2019. His arrest followed a petition forwarded to the EFCC for allegedly approving and paying furniture allowances to members of the Council. Tribune Online learnt that the EFCC had earlier invited the council members for interrogations which they declined until they were forcefully arrested. A highly placed staff of the Polytechnic told Tribune Online that the arrest was made few hours after the immediate past governor of the State, late Senator Abiola Ajimobi completed his second tenure in office as Governor. The source said: “Ogundiran alongside other members were taken to Iyaganku office of the anti-graft agency during their council meeting for investigation.” A confidential document forwarded to Governor Seyi Makinde indicated that an administrative lapse was uncovered under the watch of Dr Samuel Ogundiran in 2019 and which prompted the setting up of visitation panel of inquiry to investigate the internal wrangling in the institution.

On page 5 of the white paper report and committee’s recommendation, precisely, recommendations 27 and 28, members of the governing council then which had Dr Samuel Ogundiran as the council chairman collected overpayment allowances. Recommendation 27 goes thus: “The officers responsible for the overpayment of allowances to members of the governing council be surcharged accordingly.” A source within the school who craved anonymity disclosed that interim management was set up after the former management team led by Mr Iyiola Rasheed Eyitayo as the Rector of the institution, were asked to proceed on accumulated leave. Page 6 of the white paper report and recommendations, says: “Since the issue raised in Mr Eyitayo’s lawyer’s petition to Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is still pending and under investigation, the state governor should await the outcome of the investigation.” Stakeholders within the Polytechnic community, however, wondered why the officers involved are not being made to step aside for justice to take its course rather than reappointing such man to encourage fraudulent acts. When contacted, a top official at the EFCC office in Ibadan told Tribune Online that though Dr Samuel Ogundiran, alongside some council members, were at the EFCC office for interrogation, but he could not ascertain whether they were prosecuted at the time or not as he was not a member of the investigation team. While reacting, Dr Samauel Ogundiran, who informed that he and other members of the council were only invited by the EFCC and not arrested said the outcry of financial misconduct against him was targeted at tarnishing his image, adding that no amount of blackmail can ruffle him. He further said: “The present administration in Oyo State had set up a visitation panel to look into the allegation of misappropriation of funds and other issues that are causing resentments in the school. “The panel report was submitted to the government and the white paper of that report has been released, where non of the Council members including myself was indicted,” he said.
