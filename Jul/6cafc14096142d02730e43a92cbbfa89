The House of Representatives on Tuesday resolved to investigate the illegal withdrawal from the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) dividends account by the Management of the Nigerian National Petroleum (NNPC), amounting to $1.05 billion. This followed the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance sponsored by the Minority Leader, Hon Ndudi Elumelu at the plenary session presided over by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila. While moving the motion, Hon  Elumelu noted that NLNG was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1989 with the aim of producing liquefied natural gas and natural gas liquids for export purposes and its production kick-started in 1999. He also noted that NLNG was jointly owned by the Government of Nigeria, represented by the NNPC with a shareholding of 49%, Shell Gas B.V 25.6%, Total LNG Nigeria LTD 15% and ENI International 10.4%. Hon Elumelu said that he was: “aware that the dividends from the NLNG are supposed to be paid into the consolidated revenue funds account of the Federal Government and to be shared amongst the three tiers of government”.

The motion was unanimously adopted when it was put into voice vote by the Speaker, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila who presided over the plenary. The House, therefore, mandated the Committee on Public Accounts to invite the Management of the NNPC as well as that of the NLNG to conduct a thorough investigation on activities that had taken place on the dividends account and report back to the House in four weeks.
