Against the backdrop of the controversy surrounding the post of the Clerk of the National Assembly, the Federal Government on Monday denied that it approved an extension of service for any retiring officer in public service. A statement by the Director of Information, Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, Olawunmi Ogunmosunle, pointed out that the Head of Service, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan said no circular had been issued in respect of extension of service to any public officers. The statement read: “The Head of Service, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, has stated that the Federal Government has not approved an extension of service for any officer in public service; and the office did not issue any circular on the subject matter.
