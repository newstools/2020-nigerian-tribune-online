There is the need for market men and women to prioritise adherence to anti-COVID-19 protocols as they belong in one of the categories of Nigerians that are most susceptible to attack by the pandemic. The co-chairman of a national interreligious and intercultural body, the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDFP), Alhaji Kunle Sanni, made the remark, on Wednesday, at a one-day sensitisation programme organised for traders at Bodija Market, Ibadan. The programme was organised by the IDFP, in conjunction with the Oyo State COVID-19 Sensitisation Committee, with the support of the King Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue.

At the event, items like face masks, sanitiser, hand-washing soap, handbills and stickers were presented to representatives of the various associations in the market for onward distribution to traders in the market. A member of the IDFP, Pastor (Dr) Doyin Sowoolu, who gave a demonstration on the use of the items, sensitised the audience to a number of prescribed preventive measures against the disease. She urged the traders to continue to safeguard themselves and their families against COVID-19 through regular hand washing, use of sanitiser and wearing of face fask, as well as maintaining of social distance and avoidance of handshake and touching of the nose.
