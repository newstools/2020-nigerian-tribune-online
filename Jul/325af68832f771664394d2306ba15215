Four persons, Olajide Abeeb, 18; Christopher Seyi, 18; Rasheed Shittu, 20 and Babatunde Sikiru, 32, were arraigned before an Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun over alleged possession and smoking of Indian hemp. The Prosecutor, Abdullahi Emmanuel, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on July 24 around 08:00 am. at Ile-Ife and its environs. Emmanuel said that the defendants conspired among themselves to conduct themselves in a manner likely to cause the breakdown of law and order in Ile-Ife and its environs. He added that the defendants publicly engaged themselves in smoking of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp in the area and thereby created fears into people’s mind.
