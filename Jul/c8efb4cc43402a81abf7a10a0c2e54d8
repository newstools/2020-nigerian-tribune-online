MEMBERS of the Amalgamated Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners, Repairers and Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN), Oyo State chapter, have said that the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic compelled them to hold election of the new executive of the association at the zonal level. Rising from a meeting on Thursday in Ibadan, chairman, Zone B, comprising Oyo and Ogbomoso zones, Mr Amusa Adegoke, while speaking on behalf of other zonal chairmen told the Nigerian Tribune that the tenure of the immediate past chairman, Comrade Saheed Folaranmi, remains one year before its expiration, but the need for another election arose when he was elevated to a member of the Board of Trustees and Assistant Secretary of the national body of the association. He stated that: “We could not hold a normal election where members from the 33 Local Government Areas of the state are expected to converge on Ibadan because there was no way the social distancing rule by the government could be strictly adhered to. “This was why we decided to hold election at various zones of our association of which the outcome produced Comrade Solomon Olugbode as chairman. The reason for this meeting in Ibadan today is to restate our earlier decision of electing Comrade Solomon Olugbode as chairman of our dear association, and the outcome of the election has been duly communicated to the national body,” he said. Other members of the new executive are Soliu Lawal (Deputy chairman), Amuda Rasa (Secretary), Hamzat Adegoke (Vice-chairman, Oyo/Ogbomoso zone), Adewumi Gbadegesin (Vice-chairman, Oke-Ogun zone), Saubana Rasheed (PRO), Gazali Yekeen (Organising secretary) and Folorunsho Ogunwuyi (Ex-Officio). While speaking with the Nigerian Tribune on behalf of other executives, the new chairman, Comrade Solomon Olugbode, thanked members of the association, with a promise to always act according to the constitution of the association and in the overall interest of members. “I want to commend my predecessor, Comrade Saheed Folaranmi, for peacefully handing over the mantle of leadership without any form of rancour as we have been experiencing in the past.” He further said: “I also want to use this medium to thank the state government under the leadership of governor Seyi Makinde, for the improved security we have been enjoying since the inception of the present administration in the state, while we want to assure the government that our members will continue to sustain their peaceful conduct.” He, however, concluded by urging ACOMORAN members to always ride safely and take all precautionary measures towards their protection and that of their passengers against the COVID-19 pandemic.
