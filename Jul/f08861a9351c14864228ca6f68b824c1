The Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, has approved the appointment of Dr Daniel Ismaila Shagah as the new Hama Bachama following the demise of Honest Irmiya Stephen, the 28th ruler of the Bachama kingdom who died last month. A statement by the press secretary to the governor, Humwhashi Wonosikou, on Monday, said the governor commends the kingmakers for a peaceful process. He said as a trained Narcotics Officer and technocrat, he has no doubt in his capacity to lead his people right. He particularly praised the peaceful disposition of the new ruler adding that “I believe he will build on the legacies of late Honest Stephen who stood tall during his reign in peacebuilding initiatives.” The governor urged him to bring his community and the state his wealth of experience at a time that the state is passing through challenges of growth and development. Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri appeals to the kingdom to maintain the spirit of peacebuilding and cultural norms of their forefathers. The late Hama Bachama, Honest Stephen Irmiya, Kwire-Mana Kpafrato II, died last month after a brief illness opening the contest for his heir between the six royal clans that produced Shagah as the new king.
