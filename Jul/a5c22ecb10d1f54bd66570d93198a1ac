I read somewhere that people with malaria and COVID 19 usually have similar symptoms. If this is true, what then is the difference between COVID 19 and Malaria? Safina (by SMS)  Although COVID-19 and Malaria may have similar symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, vomiting and poor appetite, there are many differences between the two diseases. Unlike in Malaria, cough, chest pains and difficulty with breathing may also feature in COVID-19. In addition, COVID-19 unlike Malaria currently has no cure and can progress to severe stages with terrible complications.
