The Chief of Staff to Governor Kayode Fayemi and Chairman, Ekiti State Selection Committee on Special Public Works (SPW), Mr Biodun Omoleye, has said a total of N1 billion will be injected into the state’s economy quarterly when the 774000 special jobs begin. He said no fewer than 16,000 Ekiti indigenes will benefit from the government’s project targeted at employing youths across the 774 local governments in the country. He stated this at the inauguration of Ekiti State selection Committee on the Extended Special Public Works programme in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital on Monday. Omoleye, who maintained that the objective of the programme was to tackle poverty and criminality among youths, warned committee members to shun any unwholesome practices in course of their duties.

Omoleye said, “The single intervention programme will be shoring up Ekiti State revenue by close to one Billion Naira in just three months, with each local government earning N60 million quarterly. “Anybody who is not ready to be engaged as unskilled personnel needs not to apply for the programme which will be environmental and sanitation activities, cutting and clearing of road verges, filling of potholes, engaging in traffic control, beautification of public sites and distilling of blocked drains among others.” The Chairman, Ekiti State Council of Obas, Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi, commended the Federal Government for the programme and urged the people to be committed to the jobs to make it a success.
