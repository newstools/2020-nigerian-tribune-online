Eulogising the President over the milestone so far recorded on the anti-graft campaigns, the group noted: “Today, amongst other things, the country has recovered a lot of monies looted from our common treasury, and properties acquired through corruption. “We have also been saved from the criminal nightmare of the P&ID by the focus of your Government, especially through the efforts of your Patriotic and loyal Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN. “We know that hell has been let loose because of your insistence that the quantum corruption in the Niger-Delta Development Commission (NDDC) must be thoroughly investigated. “This is the first time a Nigerian President is committed to saving the Niger-Delta people through Probity. All the culprits and opposition have aligned to deceive the country, malign your person and criticize the Government. But the Nigerian Youths are with you. “We shall win those detractors and punish them under our law for their crimes.  In spite of the works of the opposition, we thank you for being open about the sabotage of the anti-corruption fight from within the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “This is the first time the EFCC itself is being cleansed, all because of your single-mindedness in fighting corruption.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
