Niger State Government has organized a stakeholder meeting with the Fulani Herdsmen within Bobi Grazing Reserve in Mariga Local Government Area of the State, as part of efforts at developing the Grazing Reserve. The meeting which was aimed at educating the Herdsmen on the need for their maximum support and participation in the Modern Animal Husbandry was presided over by the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. The Commissioner, Ministry for Livestock and Fisheries, Alhaji Haruna Nuhu Dukku, said government desires unrelented commitment from the Herders to ensure production of high-quality dairy, as failure to meet up with the required quantity will not be tolerated. Haruna Nuhu Dukku thereby assures that basic social amenities such as healthcare services, education, market among others, will be provided in the Reserve while youths and women in the Reserve will also be empowered with skills to better their lives. The Commissioner added that the Fulanis outside the Reserve will be profiled before being accepted into the reserve and all settlers in the reserve must have a national identity card for security purpose, pointing out that at the moment, there were about 300 security personnel both within and outside the Reserve comprising of Mobile Police and Men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps( NSCDC).
