The Federal Government (FG) on Monday, released a total sum of N162, 557,000,000 Sovereign Sukuk Symbolic Cheque to the Ministry of Works and Housing for the construction of 44 road projects across the country. This makes it the final batch of payments of the total N462,5577,000,000 raised by the Debt Management Office (DMO). It said that the projects span across the six geo-political zones in the country. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who received the cheque, presented to him by the Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed said each geopolitical zone has ten road projects to be financed under the Sukuk fund. While giving a breakdown of the sum allocated to each zone, he said: “North Central N26.5b, North East N30.5bn, North West N26.5bn, Southeast N26bn, South-South N26bn and South-West N27.05bn.” On the recent public debate on government borrowings and concerns raised by Nigerians, Fashola explained that the Sukuk projects distribution will give an idea of government’s spendings. He added that: “President Muhammadu Buhari has been legitimately distributing wealth through investment in road infrastructure and the 100 million Nigerians he would take out of poverty in a decade would be achieved.” Earlier, the Minister of Finance said one of the key pillars of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), is the development of critical infrastructure projects with a view to removing the impediments to growth and development in the economy.
