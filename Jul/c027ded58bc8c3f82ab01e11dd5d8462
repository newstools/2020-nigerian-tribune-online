Youths under auspices of Ondo South Youth Assembly has raised the alarm over a planned protest against the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Niger-Delta Development Commission(NDDC), Hon. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, over the ongoing probe into the affairs and finances of the Commission. The youth who raised the alarm in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Abiodun Ogunduboye, said all arrangements have been concluded by some faceless elements to mislead the people of the state on the ongoing probe on the finances of the NDDC. According to him,  some members of the group had been contacted but rejected the offer to participate in the protest organised by the faceless group. The OSYA stated in the statement that “Our attention has been drawn to a planned sponsored protest being organized by a faceless group against the person of one of the prides of Ondo State, Hon. Olubunmi Tunji- Ojo,  the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Niger-Delta Development Commission(NDDC) “We, on behalf of the good and hard-working youths of Ondo State hereby dissociate ourselves from the unpatriotic actions of the promoters of the paid protest.
