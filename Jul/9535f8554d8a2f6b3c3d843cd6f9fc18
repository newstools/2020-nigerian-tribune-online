RESIDENTS of Lagos State may have to devise ingenious means of grappling with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as galloping inflation hits practically everything needed for daily survival in the state of excellence, especially prices of foodstuffs. Tribune Online market survey in Lagos confirmed the soar-away inflation in the prices of foodstuffs and other households items, with everyday foodstuffs like rice, beans, gaari (both white and yellow), palm oil, vegetable, yam flour and tubers of yam,  recording significant price increase. A bucket of beans hitherto selling for N850 at Ketu market has jumped to N1, 100, while the same measure for rice witnessed an additional N200. A medium-size water bottle measure of red oil selling for N350 weeks back is now N500,  while a bucket of yam-flour is now N2, 100 from N1, 900. Gaari of same measure, added N100, to its price of weeks back. A kilogramme of frozen gizzard moved from N1, 600 to N1, 800, before shedding N100, which a seller said would return in weeks ahead due to the sustained fall of naira against the United States dollar. A pepper seller at Ketu market blamed the additional cost on the now-lifted ban placed on interstate movement, which kept her suppliers from the  North away. She lamented that tomatoes grown in the southern part of the country are only available for about two months in a  whole year, July and August. Speaking to Sunday Tribune, a trader in the Iyana- Ipaja area, Mrs Yetunde Adeyemo lamented the drop in sales due to the pandemic.
