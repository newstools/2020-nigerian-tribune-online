The Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, has dragged the House of Assembly to court over a planned impeachment proceeding against him by the lawmakers. The suit which was instituted by Ajayi at an Abuja High Court to halt his impeachment process by the lawmakers of the state over his defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There are speculations that the impeachment process to ease Ajayi out of office may commence today as the leadership of the House of Assembly recalls lawmakers from their recess. Also included in the suit filed by Ajayi’s lawyer are Inspector General of Police, State Commissioner of Police, Department of State Services (DSS) and the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr David Oleyeloogun, as defendants. The suit filed by Dr I. Olatoke SAN seeks to enforce the fundamental right of the deputy governor to retain his position having defected from APC to PDP.
