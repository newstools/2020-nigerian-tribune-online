The Court of Arbitration for Sport has upheld Manchester City’s appeal against their two-year ban from European competition handed down by UEFA in February. CAS has also reduced City’s fine from 30m euros to 10m. CAS verdict read: “The CAS award emphasised that most of the alleged breaches reported by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) were either not established or time-barred. “As the charges with respect to any dishonest concealment of equity funding were clearly more significant violations than obstructing the CFCB’s investigations, it was not appropriate to impose a ban on participating in UEFA’s club competitions for MCFC’s failure to cooperate with the CFCB’s investigations alone.

The Club wishes to thank the panel members for their diligence and the due process that they administered.’ However, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he is confident the club’s European ban will be overturned.
