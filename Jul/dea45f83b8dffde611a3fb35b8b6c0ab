Someone said after COVID-19, the next most-talked-about incident in Nigeria this year would be the death of the 24-year-old Air Force pilot, Tolulope Arotile. I agreed. In her life (and death), the wise must have learnt how old age and wealth count very little in calculating success. Within 24 short years, the lady ran the race of life and came tops. She won. The only wealth she had was her genius generously spiced with the right dose of diligence, resilience and patriotism. And, this gave her what mountains of naira and dollar bills have refused to give our big men and women whose lives are defined solely by how much of tomorrow’s money they steal today.
