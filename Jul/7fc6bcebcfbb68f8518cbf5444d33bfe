The Council of Legal Education has described as misleading the report that the school approved the payment of N32 million to an unnamed cleaner over a period of 12 months and N36 million as dressing allowance against Nigeria extant laws. The Secretary of the council and Director of Administration, Mrs E. Max-Uba, in a statement, on Tuesday, said, the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Prof Isa Hayatu Chiroma (SAN), was wrongly quoted when he appeared at a public hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Public Accounts (SPAC), in connection with the annual report of the Auditor-General of the Federation (AGF) on the Accounts of various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the year ended December 31st 2015. There were reports that the Office of the AGF queried the payment of N36 million as dressing allowance and the payment of N32 million to an unnamed cleaner over a period of 12 months against Nigeria extant laws. The institution admitted that queries were raised from the office of the AGF but also said explanations were equally made about how the funds were spent without the violations of extant laws.
