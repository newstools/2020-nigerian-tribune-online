Shehu Sani, returned to the EFCC as an exhibit. Dauda, under cross-examination by the defence counsel, Mr Abdul Ibrahim, told the court that he was there when his father gave the money to the EFCC as an exhibit. Dauda also told the court that he was not aware of any case his father had with the EFCC. While being led in evidence earlier by the prosecutor, Mr Abba Mohammed, Dauda told the court that the former senator met his father in November last year. According to him, Sani told his father that the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) and the EFCC were rendering some help to him (his father) and that if a token of gratitude was given, it would be appreciated. Speaking further Dauda said, “Since the former senator collected money from my father, my father never heard from him again as he neither answered his father’s calls nor called him.

Testifying further, Dauda told the court that following the instructions of the EFCC, he always set a recorder each time Sani met with his father from then on to record their conversation.
