The Senate on Tuesday urged the Federal government in its resolution to name the Ibadan Airport after the former governor of Oyo State, late Abiola Ajimobi who died on 25, June 2020. The former governor of Oyo state was also a principal officer in the Senate where he served as a minority leader between 2003 – 2007 The resolution of the Senate followed a motion by the Senator Buhari Abdulfatai (Oyo North) APC, who described the governor as a jinx breaker for returning for the second time as a governor, which was the first time in the political history of Oyo State that a serving governor got a second term. The Senate also resolved that a high powered delegation will be constituted to visit the family to commiserate with them and the people of Oyo state for the loss of the former governor who served his state for eight years.
