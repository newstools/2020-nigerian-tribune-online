I am a 40- year old married man. My wife likes to keep away from having Sexx with me for as long as two to three months. Unfortunately, I sometimes develop abdominal pain if I stay without Sexx for this period of time. Kindly let me know what I can do to solve this problem. Obioma (by SMS)  Although your wife’s refusal to have Sexx with you for such a long time is very unusual, there is no connection between s*xual abstinence and any form of ailments, abdominal pains inclusive. You may need to have a good discussion with your wife regarding her decision which could be due to psychological or medical issues. This way, the problem could be well handled. In addition, you should also seek medical advice on the cause of your abdominal pain which could also be psychological.
