The governor who gave the advice on Wednesday at a stakeholders’ meeting of political and traditional authorities of Zangon Kataf and Kauru local governments. He told them leaders should not abdicate their responsibilities, advising, elected officials and traditional rulers not to shy away from taking up the leadership roles in their communities. el-Rufai assured the stakeholders that the Kaduna State Government will uphold the right of every citizen to live in peace and harmony.

Responding to the request for firm action against persons using conventional and social media to spread fake news and panic, el-Rufai pointed out to them that ceding the narrative of events in the area “to non-formal actors is not helpful to the cause of peace and the rule of law.” A statement issued by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye after the meeting, said that the governor explained: “that it was up to the stakeholders from the area to openly controvert false narratives.” The statement recalled that Zangon Kataf and Kauru local governments have been under a 24-hour curfew, following violent clashes in the two area councils on June 11. The governor chaired the meeting which comprised security agencies and major stakeholders from the area, as part of measures to restore stability, promote peace and harmony between the affected communities. el-Rufai noted that “the portrayal of parts of southern Kaduna as unsafe spaces deters development and investments,” the statement said, adding that “he welcomed the apparent determination of the stakeholders to turn the page on the cycle of clashes and reprisals.” The statement said that the governor is awaiting advice from the core security agencies on the request to review the curfew hours, but promised to address the stakeholders demand for roads.
