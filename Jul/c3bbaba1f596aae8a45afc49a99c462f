The statement said “CUPP feels the pains and agonies of the bereaved families which forced the women of Atyap communities of Southern Kaduna to protest naked the killing of their husbands and children in the recent attacks lamenting that the killings had turned them to widows while their farmlands were no go areas due to the fear of marauders.
