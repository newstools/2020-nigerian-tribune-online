BAUCHI State government has declared its total support for the smooth takeoff of the newly established Federal College of Education in Jamaare, headquarters of Jama’are Local Government Area of the state. The assurance was given by the state governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on Wednesday in Bauchi when he received officials from the Federal Ministry of Education who paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House. Speaking through his deputy, Senator Baba Tela, the governor said the establishment of the institution would go a long way in meeting the education needs of the state. He said as part of efforts to restore the lost glory of education sector in the state, his administration had taken a number of steps to improve teaching and learning, particularly in basic education. “Since the coming of this administration, we have given priority to education. In fact, we have declared a state of emergency in the sector, and I am happy to inform you that we are seeing the benefits of that. “The importance of colleges of education cannot be over-emphasized, and therefore our administration will continue to partner with partners in the renovation and rehabilitations of our schools,” he said. He appealed to the Federal Ministry of Education to consider bringing back colleges for training of teachers so as to overcome the challenges facing the teaching profession in Nigeria. “I thank President Muhammadu Buhari for finding Jamaare worthy for the establishment of the college,” Governor Mohammed said. The leader of the delegation and a director (tertiary education) in the Federal Ministry of Education, Mr Joel Ojo, said the visit to the state was to inspect facilities at the proposed site of the institution, and that he was delighted at the hospitality extended to the team by Jamaare community. The state’s Commissioner for Education, Dr Aliyu Tilde, who led the delegation for the courtesy visit commended stakeholders who contributed towards the actualisation of the institution.
