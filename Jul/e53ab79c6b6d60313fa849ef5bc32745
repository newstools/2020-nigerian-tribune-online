Bauchi State now has a second molecular laboratory with the establishment of a N100m Genetic and Infectious Diseases Laboratory at the College of Medical Sciences, ATBUTH, by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TetFUND). While inspecting the laboratory, Bauchi State Governor, Sen Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir, showered praises on the Executive Chairman of the TetFUND, Prof Elias Suleiman Bogoro, for establishing the N100 million Molecular Laboratory as the second in the state, to carry out testing for the novel coronavirus. After the routine inspection of the laboratory, the governor said that Prof Sulaiman Bogoro was one of the indigenes that are making the state proud by using his office to improve on the standard of tertiary education in the country in general and Bauchi State in particular. An elated Bala Mohammed said: “We took the first step to approach TETFUND to say please help us and they did. People like Professor Bogoro are the kind of children we want in Bauchi State and he is really one of those that we are proud of. He is doing it, not for Bauchi, but for Nigeria and you can see the effect it has made to our health system in Bauchi State and the North-East.” He added: “The support is timely and has given us the required impetus to sharpen our capacity for health care delivery. We are grateful to all the parties involved and as a state government we will give them all the support that they require and the host community.” ALSO READ: Joint border patrol team intercepts rice concealed in sharp sand Mohammed, who was in the company of his Chief of Staff, Dr Ladan Saliu, the Executive Chairman of the State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, Commissioner for Health, Dr Aliyu Maigoro Mohammed, Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Garba Dahiru, was received by the Vice-Chancellor of ATBU, Professor Abdulaziz Mohammed and other members of his management team.
