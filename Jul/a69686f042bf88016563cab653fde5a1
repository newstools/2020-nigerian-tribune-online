Despite the record gains in three trading session last week, equities trading on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed the week bearish as the All Share Index (ASI) depreciated by 0.12 per cent to settle at 24,306.36 basis points. In the same vein, market capitalisation dropped by N15.53 billion during the week, closing at N12.68 trillion from the previous weekend’s N12.7 trillion, representing a 0.12 per cent value loss. Analyses indicate that the ASI opened the week on a negative note, losing 1.27 per cent on selloffs among high cap stocks, before Tuesday’s rebound when it gained 0.30 per cent amidst buying interests in banking stocks triggered by notifications of closed periods filed by directors of Zenith Bank and Guaranty Trust Bank. This was sustained at the midweek when the NSE index climbed 0.75 per cent up but stayed flat on Thursday as selloffs continued in the mid of position-taking in banking stocks, before closing higher on Friday when it gained 0.12 per cent as high cap stocks recorded value gain.
