The African Development Bank (AFDB), the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other financial institutions (MDBs) are collaborating to support trade finance in developing nations in a bid to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on their economy. AFDB group in partnership with the World Trade Organisation and other multilateral development banks are seeking to reduce trade finance gaps that emerge as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a joint press statement, the institutions said they would prioritise their support to areas in the world where such support is needed most, particularly the poorest countries. “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, multilateral development banks have stepped up their trade finance programs to support essential imports and key exports, as international correspondent banks have cut lending in many countries. “In addition to the ongoing shocks to supply and demand, international trade has been affected by a reduction in the supply of trade finance.
