The Chairman of the Lagos Chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Mr. Segun McMedal, has urged states and federal government to look inwards and patronise the nation’s local PR practitioners, so as to serve as a morale booster to such practitioners. McMeel, while speaking with the Nigerian Tribune, recently, stated that such patronage had become imperative to help shore up the financial fortunes of the practice,  which had been negatively impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic. According to him, PR practice in the country had not been able to maximise its potential due to lack of government’s patronage and recognition. The Lagos NIPR boss stated further that for the sector to survive the post-COVID era, it became imperative for the government, at all levels, to do more in encouraging practitioners in the profession by patronising local PR practitioners “Public Relations practitioners, in the country, have what it takes to move the profession to the next level. But one major challenge facing the practice in this part of the globe is non-patronage from the public sector. “In recent past, we still had occasions when the federal government and, even some political parties had to look beyond the shores of the land, for PR agencies. This definitely can not continue if the federal government is truly desirous of getting businesses back on their feet. “Governments in this part of the world, still remain the major spender and catalyst of the economy, that is why the need to support PR practice has become imperative,” he added. McMedal also called for a change in attitude of the nation’s financial institutions to PR practice. He noted that the wrong disposition of the nation’s financial institutions to the profession had made access to loan facilities, almost impossible for practitioners to boost their businesses. “Banks do not really understand what PR practice is all about. Unfortunately, such attitude has made it almost impossible for us to access loan facilities from them, because they can not really analyse the business,” he added. The Lagos NIPR boss also stressed the need for practitioners in the sector to be tech-savvy, so as to be able to survive in the new PR space induced by the pandemic.
