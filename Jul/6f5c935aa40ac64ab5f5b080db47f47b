Needless to say, these adjustments have made it necessary for us to revise the approved 2020 budget. “Noting the above assumptions and taking into consideration the impact of oil crash and COVID-19 on the global, national and sub-national economies, we are now proposing the total sum of one hundred and eight billion, eight hundred and twenty-two million, six hundred and eighty-three thousand, one hundred and eighty-one naira (N108,822,683,181.00) only for approval as revised estimated aggregate revenue from all sources in the fiscal year 2020. “His figure represents a reduction of eighty billion, six hundred and sixty million, eight hundred and twenty-seven thousand, eight hundred and forty-four naira (N80,660,827,844.00) or 43% from the approved the year 2020 revenue estimates,” Ortom stated.
