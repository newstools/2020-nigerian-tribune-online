The Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ART), a non-governmental body has thrown its weight behind the Federal Government’s plan to concession four of the country’s airports. The support given by the ART is coming despite the opposition of the aviation unions towards the development. Defending their position, the ART declared: “We do not need to remind industry stakeholders of the challenges facing our airports in management and funding which could be best ameliorated by a well-packaged concession programme. “Desirable as the steps are, the Aviation Round Table (ART) is cautiously optimistic that the process will be transparently done, due process and the rule of law would be observed by the government in addressing the interests of all stakeholders in the industry to ensure industrial peace and harmony.
