He was firm in his belief in fate, taking in his stride any unfortunate incident that could shake the faith of a lesser mortal. “A strong pillar upon which I more often than not rest my weight of worries, no doubt Nigeria and Sokoto state have lost a true son, patriotic and upright, in Barrister Inuwa Abdulkadir. “He passed on at a time when all of us in Sokoto needed him most, leaving a gap that would take some time to fill. “As we mourn him, I, on behalf of the family, government and good people of Sokoto, pray for the repose of his soul. May he find rest and peace in the hereafter. May Aljanna Firdaus be his final abode. Amin. “I also condole his esteemed family and assure them of our support and encouragement. May the good Lord strengthen them and give them ample fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss. Amin” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
