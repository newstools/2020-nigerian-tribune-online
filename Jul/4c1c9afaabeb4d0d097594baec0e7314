A 35-year-old man, Chukwuemeka Onoh, on Tuesday appeared in a Kubwa Grade I Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly defrauding a job seeking woman of N200, 000. The police charged Onoh with criminal conspiracy and cheating. The prosecution Counsel, Babajide Olanipekun, told the court that the complainant, Victoria Nyap, reported the matter at the Kubwa Police Station on July 22. Olanipekun said the defendant who allegedly conspired with others at large, obtained the sum of N200, 000 from the complainant. He said the defendant promised to secure a job for the complainant in the Nigerian Correctional Service but converted the said money to his personal use.
