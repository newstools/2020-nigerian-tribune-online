Osun State government, on Tuesday, announced that it has cancelled Eid prayers for this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. In a release signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, the government stated that; “having appraised how the state is currently faring with respect to the global health emergency, vis-a-vis Eid-el- Kabir, there would be no Eid congregation or prayers on Friday, July 31. However, Juma’at service will hold in line with the existing safety protocols and guidelines.” According to the release, “Osun is still recording rising figures of confirmed COVID-19 cases amidst an active community transmission stage of the pandemic.

We are not relenting in our fight to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 and to rid the state of it. The government is, and will continue to take necessary actions towards ensuring the safety and security of its people”, the release concluded.
