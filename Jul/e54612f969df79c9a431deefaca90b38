The Ekiti State organised labour has given a 14-day notice to Governor Kayode Fayemi to pay all outstanding benefits to workers or face three days warning strike. A letter dated July 16, 2020, and addressed to Fayemi, a copy of which was made available to Tribune Online said the ultimatum commences from Monday, July 20 and lapses on August 3, within which the governor is expected to redeem his pledge or face mass action. The letter was jointly signed by the Chairmen of Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC), Mr Kolapo Olatunde, his counterparts in the Trade Union Congress(TUC), Mr Sola Adigun, and Joint Negotiating Council(JNC), Mr Kayode Fatomiluyi, as well as their Secretaries. The labour demanded immediate payment of outstanding workers’ promotion arrears, deductions, salaries, allowances, bonuses and other benefits within the stipulated time, to avert industrial action in Ekiti. It regretted that they had written over five letters to the governor reminding him of the need to redeem his pledge, but without correspondence responses, which they branded as an act of “betrayal” “Arising from foregoing, we felt dazed and betrayed by the state government for not reciprocating our patriotic zeal and disposition to the state corporate governance by not acceding to any of workers’ demands since the beginning of the present administration which is now close to two years. This is painful.

Six months gross salaries and six months deductions for Local government workers and Primary School Teachers.” The organised labour frowned at the attitude of the State government for not injecting more funds into car and Housing loans to enable more workers to have access. “Also, hazard allowance for Health workers working under this ravaging COVID-19 pandemic should be paid with immediate effect, ” labour demanded. The labour said it was appalled by the planned deduction of 15 per cent from gratuities and pensions payable to pensioners without due consultation, saying the unions will support any popular decision taken by the pensioners on the matter. It urged the government to finetune arrangements for the signing of the final agreement for the implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage across the board.
