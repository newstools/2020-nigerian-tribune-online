Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Walid Jibril has said that presidential ambition was responsible for the defection of the former speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara. Jibril said this in a statement in Monday arguing that Dogara knew he could not achieve that in the PDP as he dismissed the reasons Dogara advanced for leaving the party. Dogara had alleged that the Governor of the state, Senator, Bala Mohammed had contracted payment of salaries among other malfeasance. The BOT said: “I have read with mixed feelings the reason given by former speaker House of Representatives Mr Yakubu Dogara for decamping to APC. “I am equally sorry for Dogara for not adhering to all avenues available in the party constitution for settlement of disputes or complaints by a member of the party. “I became more disturbed when the reasons given by Mr Dogara for his decamping considering his position as a former speaker.

He further said the BoT of the party is strongly behind the candidature of Governor Obaseki as PDP flag bearer for Edo state “I want to assure the former speaker that PDP shall continue to be very strong and united and its doors remain open to all Nigerians, therefore, PDP will never accept any plan from anybody to destroy the party. “As Chairman of BoT, I urge all members of the party to remain calm and strong as the BoT will continue to play its role as the conscience of the party as contained in its constitution. Similarly, BoT is in total support of Godwin Obaseki in becoming the new Governor of Edo state. “ NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
