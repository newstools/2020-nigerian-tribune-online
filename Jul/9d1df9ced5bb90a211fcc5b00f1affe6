Rising from an emergency meeting held at the labour house in Minna the state capital on Thursday, the Organised Civil servants in Niger state, have again rejected the planned slash in their salaries by the Governor Abubakar Sani Bello- led state government. This was just as the organised labour has said it will organise “special prayer session to seek divine intervention in the matter.” The state government had last week, informed state’s labour unions that it will reduce salaries of the state’s workforce by 30 per cent and those of local government employees by 40 per cent, blaming its decision on poor revenue receipt from Federation Account. A communique issued at the end of the emergency meeting, on Thursday said, “it has also rejected any form of renegotiation of salaries as it is not in tandem with any extant laws of the land.

The Congress, therefore, resolved to host special prayer session to invoke divine intervention that will lead to the payment of salaries. Finally, the meeting “expressed loss of trust in Niger state government and expressed serious fears over the faith of 7.5 per cent CPS (Contributory Pension Scheme) being administered by the government.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
