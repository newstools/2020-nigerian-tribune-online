The Kogi  State Government has approved a bill for the establishment of Confluence University of Science and Technology, Osara, in the state. The move was aimed at training manpower in science-related courses to feed available industries in the state. The State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Mr Kingsley Fanwo, disclosed this at a news conference on Thursday in Lokoja. The commissioner said that the bill for the establishment of the university at Osara in Adavi Local Government Area would be transmitted to the State House of Assembly by the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice as soon as possible. Fanwo said that the establishment of the Science and Technology University in Osara was approved by the State Executive Council (SEC) during its weekly meeting on Wednesday.

Fanwo urged the people of Kogi to continue to live in peace and harmony as well as continue to support the administration of Gov. Yahaya Bello to enable him to deliver the much-needed dividends of democracy to the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the state already has two universities – Prince Abubakar Audu University (PAAU) in Anyigba, Kogi East and the Federal University Lokoja (FUL) in Lokoja in Kogi West, and now the Kogi State University of Science and Technology in Osara, Kogi Central.
