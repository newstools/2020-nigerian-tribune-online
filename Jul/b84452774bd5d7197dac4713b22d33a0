Former Nigeria Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has faulted the decision of the Nigeria government to cancel the West African School Examination (WAEC), saying it is not in the country’s best interest, rather, it will set back the nation’s youth, putting them behind their contemporaries in other West African nations. Recall that the Minister of Education, on Wednesday, said exiting students, who are preparing for their final examinations, will not be able to return to school any time soon because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry had also previously rescheduled WAEC to commence August 3 but made a U-turn on that decision due to the pandemic. Atiku, on his Twitter page on Friday, said: “As a parent and investor in the education sector, I wish to register the fact that the Nigerian government’s policy of unilaterally cancelling the West African Senior School Certificate Examination, held annually by the West African Examinations Council, is not in Nigeria’s best interest. “At a time of the global COVID19 pandemic, it is understandable that an abundance of caution be put in place to save lives. However, caution, without consultation, and thoughtful action, may be counterproductive.

To abruptly cancel this examination is to set back our nation’s youth, and place them behind their contemporaries in other West African nations. “This is perilous because Foreign Direct Investments and other economic indicators are tied to the educational indexes of nations. “Already, Nigeria lags behind other African nations in crucial indices, like school enrolment, pass rates, and out of school children. This action, will further create chaos in the public education system and exacerbate an already bad situation. “Rather than cancellation, there are better ways to protect the health of Nigerians and prevent the pandemic from escalating. “We could mobilise all available public and private infrastructures including primary schools, stadia, and cinemas, for the examinations. In the alternative, the Federal Government can prevail on WAEC to have staggered examinations with a different set of questions for each shift. “Doing so will allow WAEC Nigeria implement social distancing and achieve the goal of carrying out the examinations. A win-win scenario. “I urge this administration to take into account that the lives they are trying to save will be further put at risk, because if this policy is not reversed, tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands of Nigerians, will breach social distancing rules to cross over to neighbouring West African nations to write their WASSCE, rather than miss a year.” NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
