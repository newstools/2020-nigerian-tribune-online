The Chairman of Ogun APC Caretaker Committee, Chief Yemi Sanusi, has directed all party members that are in court for one reason or the other to immediately withdraw the litigations without further delay. He disclosed this shortly after the monthly meeting of the State Working Committee (SWC) held at the state party secretariat, Abeokuta, on Wednesday. The party Chairman said the directive for members to end all litigations was in compliance with the resolution of the 8th National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, and presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on June 25, 2020, “wherein it was resolved that all pending litigations in all various courts in Nigeria should be withdrawn by party members who instituted the suits. “The decision of  NEC has been communicated to the Ogun State Chapter through a letter dated July 1, 2020, addressed to All-State Chairmen of APC and signed by the National Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, the State Working  Committee met today and we unanimously passed a resolution to fully abide with the NEC’s directive.
