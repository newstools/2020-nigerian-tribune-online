The Taraba State government, on Monday, announced tax relief measures to ease the effect of COVID-19 on citizens and businesses in the state. Commissioner for Finance, Dr Jesse Ashumate, announced the measures at a press conference in Jalingo. Ashumate said the Taraba State government was conscious of the threat of COVID-19 on businesses, organisations and individuals and approved the measures to cushion the effects of the pandemic. According to him, the measures include; extension of timeline for filing withholding tax return from 21st day to the last working day of the month following the month of deduction. “50 per cent reduction on personal income tax (PIT) of informal sector taxpayers made before December 31st 2020. “Use of electronic platforms for payment of taxes and processing of tax clearance certificate as well as the automatic discharge of vehicles update arrears beyond one year of expiration ending December 31st 2020. “Automatic waiver of 50 per cent arrears volume on back duty assessment before September 2020. “Allow instalment payment on tax due to informal sector taxpayers into an agreed segment of the deferral settlement programme,” he said. The Commissioner added that waiver has been granted for late filing of returns penalty for taxpayers whose return are submitted after June 30th 2020. This is even as he said desk reviews and tax audit request information will be communicated through electronic mail. The Finance Commissioner noted that Governor Darius Ishaku approved the measures in line with global realities, adding “countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and even the Federal Government have given such incentives to their citizens and the Taraba State government cannot be left out.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
