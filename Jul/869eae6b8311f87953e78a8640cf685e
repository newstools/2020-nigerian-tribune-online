The Oyo State government has maintained that no administration, after 1995, bought water drilling rig for the State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA) except the present administration. This restatement is against the backdrop of positions expressed on social media handles of former governor Adebayo Alao Akala that his administration procured 33 brand new borehole drilling machines and that the Governor Seyi Makinde administration was not stating the facts. In a statement, on Thursday, state Chairman of RUWASSA, Mr Najeem Omirinde, held that Alao Akala never bought rigs for the state but rather used local government funds to buy rigs for each of the 33 local government areas in the state. Omirinde said the rigs RUWASSA had been using in the state were those donated by UNICEF and Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) and purchased by the state government. He described the rigs bought by the former governor for local government areas as substandard and ‘toy rigs’ that didn’t last six months before they become faulty.
