Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong in a statement said the attack on Governor Zulum’s convoy who was on his way to Baga, a commercial town in Kukawa Local Government Area to personally distribute relief materials to internally displaced persons for the Sallah celebrations was calous.
