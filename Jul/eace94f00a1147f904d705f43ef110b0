The Board of Ekiti State Security Network popularly referred to as Amotekun corps has commenced the process of recruiting personnel for the security network in the state. The state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi had in March signed into law the Bill backing the establishment of the network aimed at ending the scourge of kidnappings, killings and other heinous crimes in the state. Speaking with Tribune Online in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital on Wednesday, the Amotekun Corps Commander, Brig- General Joe Komolafe (Rtd) urged qualified persons in the state between the ages of 18 and 60 with a minimum qualification of Primary School leaving certificate to apply online. According to him, each applicant would be required to collect a letter from their traditional rulers affirming their citizenship of the community and character, revealing people of questionable behaviours would not be part of the corps.

The corps commander added that he got the mandate of the governor to supervise the network as a result of his proven track records and integrity,  calling on politicians to steer clear of the recruitment process. He said, ” We have started the recruitment process and we call on our people who are interested in being part of Amotekun to go online at  www.amotekun.ekitistate.gov.ng and apply. The instructions are there and I want to say that everyone that will work in this corps will be someone who has not involved himself or herself in any form of crime or unworthy act. “Our traditional rulers will play a key role in this regard as these applicants will need attestation letter from them to confirm whether they are from the community and never involved in any form of criminality. “There won’t be room for politicians in this regard and the governor has told me that he will give me free hand to do this very important job and achieve the desire results of securing Ekiti. I won’t allow any politician to compromise the standard set for the security outfit and I can assure you that we will not allow politics to derail us.” Komolafe maintained that the establishment of Amotekun was a child of necessity to checkmate the scourge of insecurities ravaging south-west states, assuring residents that the corps would be above board in securing the state. He, however, called on residents to support the security outfit in their communities with accurate and timely information, noting, “this is our own security operation and it must not fail.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
