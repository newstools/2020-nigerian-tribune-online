The bill seeks to provide security for the underage-undergraduate in the tertiary institutions and insulate them from sexual molestation by unscrupulous lecturers. The consideration of the committee of the whole was not without contention of clause 7 which grants the undergraduate the status of a minor in a sexual harassment case and made the lecturer liable in any such case between him and his student. President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, in his remark said the process of protecting young girls and female undergraduates was a good task to undertake and commended his colleagues for the diligence so far demonstrated in consideration of the bill. According to him: “We have to protect our daughters and our mothers from predators. We could see clearly that we wanted a very fair means of determining what offence somebody is accused of, so, it is balanced legislation.” Details later… YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Journalists Barred As Panel Grills Magu In Aso Rock The acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, is currently being grilled by a panel set up to investigate alleged infractions against him… Read Full Story Hushpuppi Hires Michael Jackson’s Former Lawyer To Represent Him In Court Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, a suspected internet fraudster and Instagram celebrity, who was arrested recently has reportedly hired a former lawyer to Michael Jackson, Mark Geragos, to represent him in court… Read Full Story COVID-19: Trump Govt Threatens Foreign Students With Expulsion International students who are pursuing degrees in the United States will have to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online-only courses, Immigration and Customs Enforcement… Read Full Story PHOTOS: After Four Months, Oyo Schools Reopen Monday After about four months, students in primary six, JSS3 and SSS3 in Oyo State resume at their various schools on Monday.
