I have had a small growth the size of a small egg on the left side of my neck for the past one year. Although it is not getting any bigger, the appearance of the lump is embarrassing. Some of my friends want me to remove it but I am afraid. Kindly advise me. I am 60 years of age. Ibrahim (by SMS)  It is usually advisable to remove any suspicious lump from any part of the body particularly, at an advanced age as yours. After removal, such a lump should be sent to the laboratory for a pathological investigation in order to rule out any possibility of malignancy. You have nothing to fear when the removal is done by a competent medical doctor. The earlier you do so, the better.  YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
