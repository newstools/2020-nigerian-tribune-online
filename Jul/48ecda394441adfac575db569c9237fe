The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Wednesday said the 2019 batch “B” stream II passing-out event will hold across the country on 16th July 2020. Also, it said due to the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the event will be low-key. The scheme, in a statement issued and signed by its Director press and public relations, Mrs Adenike Adeyemi, in Abuja, said qualified Corps Members would receive their Certificates of National Service (CNS) at the Local Government level. It further disclosed that distribution of the Certificate of National Service would be staggered for a period of ten days in the first instance, in keeping with the safety measures established by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
