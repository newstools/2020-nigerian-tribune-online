Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has again tested positive for COVID-19, the country’s Communications Ministry said on Wednesday. The 65-year-old is in good health, the ministry told dpa by email. “Bolsonaro has no fever and his breathing, heartbeat and blood pressure are normal,’’ CNN Brazil reported. The positive test result was at least the third for the far-right populist president, who for months downplayed the severity of the pandemic and still advocates keeping the economy open. Bolsonaro is currently working from his residence. Several of his ministers have also been diagnosed with COVID-19.
