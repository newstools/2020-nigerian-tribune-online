Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Thursday said that the plan by the Miyett Allah Kautal Hore to establish vigilante group nationwide was an agenda to elevate their nefarious and inhuman activities to another level. Governor Ortom who was reacting to the statement credited to the Fulani socio-cultural association, “Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore”, in which it announced the establishment of its security outfit called ‘Miyetti Allah Vigilante’ to operate nationwide warned the association, not to date near Benue State for its plan. Ortom in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase said that if Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore is considering floating a security outfit in other states, he said that such plan should not be extended to his state saying, “such a vigilante group will not operate in Benue State.” The governor said that Benue is already working with conventional security forces and had already established a vigilante group at the state, local government and ward levels. According to the statement, “This is evident in the ongoing recruitment of personnel for Community Policing who will soon be trained as recommended by Inspector General of Police. “The idea of running a nationwide vigilante group is a mere strategy by the Fulani socio-cultural organization to elevate their nefarious and inhuman activities to another level. “They have repeatedly claimed responsibility for the killing of thousands of children, women and other vulnerable people in different states, yet, members of the group walk freely in Abuja and hold press conferences threatening to unleash terror on the people of this country. “We once more call for the arrest and prosecution of officials of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, to end the spate of crime in the country. “We urge the Federal Government to stop looking elsewhere for bandits who have been killing innocent Nigerians. Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore is coordinators of banditry in the country, and officials of the group reside in Abuja. YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
