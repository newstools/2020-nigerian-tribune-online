The Defence Headquarters, (DHQ), on Monday, reacted to a statement credited to the National Chairman of National Democratic Party (NDP), Chidi Chukwuanyi, that “the state of corruption in the country calls for the replication of the Ghanian experience under former President Jerry Rawlings in Nigeria” describing it as reckless and inciting the Military personnel against the constituted Civil Authority in the country. This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, DMO, Major John Enenche. The DHQ pointed out that “what Chidi Chukwuanyi is calling for is a combination of unpopular acts of insurrection and mutiny, which cannot be taken for granted by the Armed Forces of Nigeria.” ALSO READ:  Oba Palace Attack: We are not intimidated ― PDP It, however, stated  “clearly and unequivocally that the Nigerian Military is a force that is in consonance with all global best practices and cannot be misguided by any individual or group” and that  “for the avoidance of doubt, the Armed Forces of Nigeria is totally loyal to the President Commander-in-Chief and fully subordinated to the civil authorities of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”.
