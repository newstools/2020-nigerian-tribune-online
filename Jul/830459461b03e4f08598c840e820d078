The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has come up with a forum meant to help citizens express their grievances as it relates to indigenous IT product and services and settle such in a non-litigious manner. Mallam Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Director-General of NITDA, represented by Dr Usman Gambo Abdullahi, Director IT Infrastructure Solutions, NITDA at Webinar with theme; “Virtual Digital Services Consumer Protection Forum,” where a Draft Framework on Alternative Dispute Resolution for the ICT Sector was presented for review. He said the occasion was very critical to the success of NITDA’s strategy which is aimed at building qualitative indigenous content for consumption in the ICT sector. Abdullahi stated that the multiple complaints and quality of ICT products and services has lead to the conceptualisation of the consumer forum as well as drafting the alternative dispute resolution in the ICT framework. He expressed concern that leaving such issues unattended will lead to lack of confidence in local ICT products and services, which in turn attract to very low patronage and job losses.
