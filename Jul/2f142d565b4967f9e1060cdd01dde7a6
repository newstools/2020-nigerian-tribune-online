Anambra State Ministry of Transport says it has put in place, plans to fight challenges of illegal and multiple ticketing in the state’s transport sector. The State Commissioner for Transport, Mr Afam Mbanefo, announced this during a meeting with various transport associations in the state, on Monday. “We want to stop illegal and multiple ticketing in the Anambra transport sector,” Mr Mbanefo said. Mbanefo explained that the Ministry would work with the state Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) unit and drivers’ union to harmonise and create unified ticketing in the transport sector. He urged the associations to ensure they register with the Traffic Command and Control Centre of the Ministry. According to him, the Ministry can only deal with registered associations with evidence of tax payment. Public Relations Officer (PRO), Urban Drivers Welfare Association (UDWASS), Mr Kingsley Adiele, commended the commissioner for the move to solve challenges of ticketing in the transport sector. The PRO promised the support of the drivers union in helping the commissioner to solve the challenges, in line with the vision of the state governor, Willie Obiano.
