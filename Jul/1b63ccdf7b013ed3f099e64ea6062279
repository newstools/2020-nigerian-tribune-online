Ahead of the Sallah celebration slated for the weekend, the Department of State Services (DSS) on Monday raised the alarm over the alleged plan to destabilize the country In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by its Spokesman, Dr Peter Afunanya, the Service disclosed that it had uncovered plans by some persons and groups desirous of taking advantage of latest developments in parts of the country to destabilize it. The DSS fingered some unnamed prominent personalities and Socio-cultural groups as being the brain behind the ignoble act with a strict warning to those concerned to retrace their steps or face the full wrath of the law of the land According to the statement, “some prominent personalities and socio-cultural groups have resorted to divisive acts through inciting statements aimed at pitching individuals, groups and ethnic nationalities against another.
