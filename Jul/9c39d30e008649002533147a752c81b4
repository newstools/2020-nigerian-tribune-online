He said, “The cause of the accident cannot be immediately ascertained for now, because the only person that could have given a lead in that regards is the injured victim whose case is critical because he can neither talk nor make any gesture that can give a lead. But we suspect it could be as a result of brake failure and loss of control due to overspeeding.” Adebiyi said the accident vehicle had been taken off the road for a free flow of traffic.
