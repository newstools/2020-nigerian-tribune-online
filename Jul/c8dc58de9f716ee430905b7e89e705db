Lagos State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) said it has not nominated or endorse anybody as its candidate for the forthcoming Lagos East Senatorial District bye-election as it is still mourning the death of Senator Sikiru Adebayo Osinowo, who formerly occupied the post on the party platform. Osinowo, a four-time Lagos State House of Assembly member, who got elected into the Senate in 2019, died last month during a brief illness and had since been buried according to Islamic rites. APC said this in a statement made available to newsmen by its spokesperson, Hon. Seye Oladejo, in reaction, to report circulating which claimed that a former commissioner in the state had been handed over the ticket of the party. The party, while debunking the report, which it said its attention was drawn to, pointed out that the process of selecting a candidate was yet to commence for a number of reasons. According to it, while it is still mourning the demise of its chieftain, Senator Osinowo, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is yet to officially notify the party of the scheduled bye-election.
