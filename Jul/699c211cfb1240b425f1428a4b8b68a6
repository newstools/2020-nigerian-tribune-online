The Chairman of the South-West Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has described the late factional leader of Afenifere, Senator Ayo Fasanmi, as a patriot whose positive exploits will not be forgotten in a hurry. Akeredolu stated this in a statement issued and signed by the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, described Fasanmi, “as one of the few men standing, personified integrity and exemplified altruism.” Akeredolu said: “Baba lives on because of his positive exploits and demonstrated capacity to lead a people. “Fasanmi bequeathed courage, planted love and displayed an insatiable quest for a just, equitable and egalitarian Nigeria. “His thoughts were laced with candour and palpable emotional attachment for his people, the Yoruba Nation and Nigeria at large. “These thoughts were truly Nigeran and reflected in all ways, an inexorable passion for humanity. “As a true son of the old Ondo State, Governors of both States and indeed, all South West Governors, will commence talks with the immediate family to give this Patriot, befitting internment.” The family of late Fasanmi in the early hours of Thursday announced the demise of Pa Fasanmi, one of the lieutenants of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Fasanmi, a Second Republic Senator passed on at the age of 95. YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
