The Ekiti State organised labour has maintained a hard stand over unresolved issues surrounding unpaid benefits, as it directed workers to proceed on a three-day warning strike beginning from Monday, August 3. The strike, according to the Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC), Trade Union Congress(TUC) and Joint Negotiating Council (JNC) was to pressure Governor Kayode Fayemi to pay outstanding salaries, allowances and pension arrears of their members. The State government and organised labour have been embroiled in a cold war over unpaid seven months salary arrears of local government workers and primary school teachers, as well as pensioners, three-month arrears for secondary school teachers and civil servants and outstanding gratuities spanning over ten years. Others contentious payments include: leave bonus from 2015 till date, arrears of promotions for workers at all levels, deductions and implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage across the board. The outstanding payments, which progressively accumulated during Governor Ayodele Fayose’s regime became an albatross for Fayemi, having promised to defray the arrears totalling N57 billion within one year he assumed office for his second term. The directive was contained in a statement jointly signed by the Chairmen of NLC, Comrade Kolapo Olatunde; TUC, Comrade Sola Adigun and JNC, Comrade Kayode Fatomiluyi on Friday.
