The Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) over the weekend intercepted contrabands worth N15.6bn while also raising debit notes on importers worth N1.4bn, thereby collecting a total of 17bn within the South Western part of the country between January to June 2020. While contrabands intercepted by the unit were from smugglers terrorising the South Western part of the country, which included Used vehicles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, foreign parboiled rice, tomato paste, second-hand clothing among others, the debit notes were raised on importers who under-declared their cargoes for lesser Customs duty. Speaking to newsmen at the weekend, the Customs Area Controller of the unit, Usman Yahaya said N15.6billion was generated from contrabands seized from smugglers while N 1.4billion was raised from wrong classification, transfer of value and false declaration of cargoes.
