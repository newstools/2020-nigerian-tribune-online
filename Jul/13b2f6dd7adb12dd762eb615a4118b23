The Federal government has announced that a total of 7,713 inmates have been released from the various correctional centres across the country since the outbreak of the COVID-19 in the country, to curb the spread of the virus among inmates. The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) who disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja, on Tuesday, to celebrate the achievement of the Presidential Committee on Correctional Service Reform and Decongestion, since it was inaugurated in October 2017, said the measure was taken to reduce risk of inmates contracting the virus. According to the AGF, the Committee, since its inauguration, has visited and appraised about 39 prisons in 18 states and has released a total of 7,713. He said it is pertinent to note the inadequacy of Nigeria’s correctional facilities, which are currently operating at more than 150% of their capacity and added that there is an ongoing construction of 3000-capacity maximum security custodial centres in Karshi, Abuja and in Janguza, Kano State. The AGF said, “Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed its own peculiar challenges in light of the worrisome and dilapidated state of our correctional centres nationwide.
