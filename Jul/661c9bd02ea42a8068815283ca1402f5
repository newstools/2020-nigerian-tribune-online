The Federal Government (FG) on Monday explained that the partial closure of the third mainland bridge will be in two phases. It stated that the first phase will begin Friday 24th, July 2020 at midnight and last till 23rd October, while the second phase will start from 24th October till 23rd January 2021. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, made the disclosure at a briefing on the closure of the Third mainland bridge in Abuja. According to him, this is to allow contractors to carry out operational efficiency even as he noted that both phases are subdivided into morning and afternoon sessions, to allow for ease of traffic. He explained that the maintenance became imperative as the bridge is the busiest with about 132,702 light and heavy vehicles using it on a daily basis.

He said a total of 37 bridges were identified across the country, adding that the third mainland bridge was one of the critical ones that needed urgent maintenance. “Between 2015 and 2019, we undertook a survey of all the bridges in Nigeria  and we did an assessment to determine their position, the urgency of the need to repair them. Some were critical, some were less and the third mainland bridge was one of those bridges. “At the time, we designated that we would need about N227billion to do all the planning work over a period of four years as you all know, we did not get the budget that we expected but we got something and we need to have started work over the last two year. ” Currently, we are to intervene on 37 bridges across Nigeria.” Fashola said the third mainland was also by far the largest of all the bridges identified. However,  he assured that the FG  would ensure that the maintenance work is completed within the 6 months period as planned. NIGERIAN TRIBUNE SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
