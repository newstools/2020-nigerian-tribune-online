The Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Abdullahi Gana, on Sunday dispelled rumours regarding the extension of his tenure which was said to have been extended for five years. A statement signed by the Media Assistant to the Commandant General, Ekunola Gbenga, and sent to Tribune Online, stated that: “The Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps ‘NSCDC’, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu on Sunday dispelled the insinuations by some mischief makers that his tenure which was to end on July 17, 2020, has been extended for five years. “This is misleading and mischievous and it should be disregarded by the general public.” Gana also disclosed that President Buhari only extended his tenure of service for six months, with effect on July 17, 2020, as against the purported five years claim by some mischievous members of the public.
