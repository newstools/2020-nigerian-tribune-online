AN Ilorin, Kwara State-based lawyer, Hajiya Aisha Subair Sanni, winner of the 2020 edition of the Nasrul-Lahi-l-Fatih Society (NASFAT)’s ‘My Hijab Story’ competition, said she hid six different hijabs on body during her call to Bar in 2017 so that she could wear a hijab to the podium to collect her certificate. Sanni explained that her certificate was actually seized for daring to wear hijab to the podium. She said: “On the call to Bar Day in December 2017, we were not allowed to wear hijabs to the hall. They were seized from us. But I had up to six hijabs hidden on my body. So, when the hijab I wore was seized at the entrance, I put on another one. When that was seized again, I wore another one. And when the event started, I used another one to the podium where I was expected to receive my certificate. “But as I walked down the podium, I was accosted by officials who dragged the hijab off my head and seized it. For daring to use the hijab at the venue, my certificate was seized. “It was indeed a traumatic experience for me but it renewed my steadfastness and commitment to fighting for freedom to use hijab as guaranteed by Allah. I was motivated by Allah’s commandment to all female Muslims to wear hijab. It is non-negotiable for Muslimahs to wear hijab. “I commend NASFAT for this lofty idea as it promotes the use of hijab among female Muslims. It also helps us to build our confidence even in the public in spite of the ceaseless persecution of Muslims by government agencies and organisations.” The competition, which was designed for female Muslims between ages 12 and 25, according to NASFAT’s National Women Affairs Secretary, Alhaja Suebat Kupolati, was organised to step up campaign for the use of hijab among Muslim women and girls.

Alhaja Kupolati said: “For this year’s World Hijab Day celebration, we felt we should take a step further in our campaign for the use of hijab hence the competition tagged ‘My Hijab Story’ which drew participants from all NASFAT zones and headquarters across the country and the United Kingdom. “We also visited schools in Lagos State to inform them about the competition and about the beauty and benefits of wearing the hijab. “However, in the course of this, we had the opportunity of talking to one of the principals that do not allow their students to wear hijab while in uniform. Consequent to our visit, we heard he now allows hijab in his school. “As innovative as NASFAT is, we decided to introduce another dimension to the hijab campaign with ‘My Hijab Story’ competition where participants send in entries narrating their experiences wearing hijab. So, we have our winners and I am glad to inform you that we are here today to present their prizes to them.” Sanni, who came first in the competition, was presented with a laptop, while the first runner-up, a woman from Suleja, Niger State, won a tablet phone. A 13-year-old NASFAT member from Ikotun branch won the third prize of a smart phone which was converted to a cash of N75,000 and was given to her mother. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
