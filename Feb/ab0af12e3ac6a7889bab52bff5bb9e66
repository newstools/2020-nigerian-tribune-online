Citing high handedness and a penchant for engaging in factional politics, executive members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Uhunmwode Local Government chapter, Edo State has unanimously passed a vote of no confidence on Mr Charles Idahosa, the former Senior political adviser to the immediate past governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. In his place, Prof. David Osifo, a former Edo state Commissioner for Health and four others were nominated to pilot the political affairs of the party in the local government. They maintained that they had no choice but to suspend him from the party following his role in under-developing the local government with his self-serving style of politics.

Charles Idahosa which has resulted in the underdevelopment of the local government area. “Hon. Charles Idahosa has appropriated our great party to himself and therefore runs and conducts the affairs as his privately owned limited liability company where he is both the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.” “Charles Idahosa by his activities continues to compromise the growth of our great party by supporting and promoting the factionalisation of our great party, as well as sabotaging genuine efforts by well-meaning leaders and members of our great party aimed at attracting more people to our great party.” Idahosa said the gathering where he was purportedly suspended was not a meeting of Uhunmwode APC but a congregation of the Edo People’s Movement (EPM). “The people there are working for the money Oshiomhole is giving them. Is Samson Osagie in APC? Is that Uhunmwode APC? Is Osagie Ize-Iyamu from Uhunmwode? Didn’t you see the people there? Is Ogiemwonyi from Uhunmwode?” Idahosa queried. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
