Following the lingering security challenges in the country, the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on security. NSCIA said Nigerians are dying needlessly to the satisfaction of the evil-minded political profiteers, hence the need to declare a state of emergency on security becomes necessary. Addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, the Director of Administration of NSCIA, Alhaji Yusuf Chinedozi Nwoha, sais the level of insecurity in the country has reached an unacceptable crescendo that declaring a state of emergency on it appears not only necessary but also pressing. “The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), under the leadership of its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, mni, CFR, is appalled and horrified by the state of insecurity in Nigeria.

We equally urge the Federal Government to review and reinvent its security architecture by injecting more vim into security operations all over the country without further delay,” NSCIA said.
