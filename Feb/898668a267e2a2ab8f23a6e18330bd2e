Jadon Sancho is expected to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer and Manchester United are keen to take him to Old Trafford. The forward, who turns 20 next month, has become a full England international since joining Dortmund from Manchester City in 2017. He is expected to feature at the Euro 2020 finals this summer and has regularly been linked with a move to the Premier League. Sky in Germany reporter Jesco von Eichmann said: “He will leave Dortmund this summer, that’s for sure.

Today, I asked him again, and he just smiled! “There will be some offers for Sancho in the future. He is improving. He was very tired at the end of the first part of the season but now he’s very fit and performing very good. He improved his behaviour. “He had some trouble coming in on time – he came more or less late every day. He changed that and he is really improving. “He is working hard in training so (head coach) Lucien Favre is pretty happy with him right now. “I guess he thought over some things in the winter break and now he is working like the professional that he wasn’t before.” Sky Sports News have contacted Manchester United for comment and are awaiting their response.
