We have taken this very seriously, working with Mr President. We just inaugurated a committee made up of very seasoned men and women who are currently serving in the Senate, to help us make a review and recommend to us what we should do before communicating same to Mr President. “There has been so many suggestions on the table that came out during our debate a couple of days ago. Some suggesting that we create state police to address some of these concerns. Some are suggesting that rather than state police, we should go for community policing, where we will bring in the average man and woman in the community as we had in the past, to provide and gather information and intelligence to be shared with the reformed, existing police structure. “This is the first time in a very long time that both the Executive and the Legislature are trying to come together and address this once and for all. We will do this to make sure that the death of our brother, Michael, is not in vain.” He commended the priests for providing psycho-spiritual therapy to the people.
