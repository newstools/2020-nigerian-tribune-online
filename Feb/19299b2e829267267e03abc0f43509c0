Total Exploration and Production Nigeria has concluded plans to train nine Nigerian lecturers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of its efforts to build local capacity in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Speaking at the panel interview session for shortlisted candidates, for the MIT-Empowering the Teachers (ETT) 2020 Fall/2021 Spring Fellowship, Manager Diversity, Total, Mr Azu Azuike, disclosed the successful lecturers would be undergoing a one-semester training at the MIT. He added that the MIT-ETT project was part of Total’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, done in conjunction with its partners. Azuike disclosed that the best nine lecturers would be selected from 250 shortlisted candidates from about 500 applications from various university lecturers in the country. “For this specific season, we had almost 500 lecturers that applied globally. Of these 500, 250 were actually qualified to be at this last level. “We normally screen it down to only 20 lecturers for the panel interview, so, we have to do a whole lot of screening down and effectively, we are taking less than 10 per cent of the qualified. It is very stringent and what you are seeing here are like best of the best, so to speak,’’ he said. He noted that each of the shortlisted candidates would make two presentations of a research work and teaching skills. “We hold a general assessment, we look at the research work and see how well the person have a grasp of the work and if you can teach it,’’ he added Azuike said that since the inception of the programme in the country in 2010, it had impacted positively on the academia and by extension, the oil and gas industry.

He said that Total was talking with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to get other international oil companies (IOC) involved to help expand the number of participants in the programme. Also speaking, Professor Akintunde Ibitayo Akinwande, of MIT’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, stated that most of the lecturers who had passed through the programme had improved on what they do on an individual basis. He said that some of them had also tried to do systemic changes, some at the teaching level, some at the mentoring level and at a visionary level. “I think things have succeeded because we have started to see tangible results. At the end of the day, it is what the students can do that matter most. “The focus in the past used to be what students can remember and by changing the focus from that, it has really made the students that are coming out of the school to be more competitive in respect to work,’’ he said.
