The nation’s opposition political parties under the umbrella of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) on Saturday said that it was shocked to receive the news of visa restriction placed on Nigerians by the United States government. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by national spokesman, Barr. Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, the coalition declared that the development was one of the visible signs of the pariah state which President Muhammadu Buhari had turned the country into. According to the coalition, “the truth is that the regime of the military junta, General Sani Abacha, in all its ingloriousness, was far better than this present administration.  “All indices are pointing to the fact that this All Progressives Congress government is bent on running this country aground. “All parts of the country are currently under security siege with killings, kidnappings, banditry and insurgency becoming the order of the day.
