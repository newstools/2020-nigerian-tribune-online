The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Working Committee has dropped President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan as chairman of its National Reconciliation Committee. A statement signed by its national publicity secretary, Mallam Lanre Isa-Onilu announced pioneer national chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande as the new chairman of what it called Reconstituted 12-Member Reconciliation Committee. No reason was given for the removal of the President of the Senate. Tribune Online checks revealed that the party had last December constituted a 10-member Committee with Ahmed Lawan as chairman and the former Osun State governor as vice-chairman. But supporters of the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki had protested the leadership of the troubleshooting team by Senator Lawan. The Obaseki/Shaibu Movement (OSM), a support group for the re-election of the governor and his Deputy, Philip Shuaibu, rejected the composition of the committee. In a statement, convener of the group, Honourable Damian Lawani, protested the constitution of the committee, noting that some of those selected as members were interested parties in some of the crisis flashpoints, which called to question their neutrality in carrying out their assignment.

Leader of the Senate, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi appeared to have replaced the President of the Senate in the list released on Monday. In the reconstituted 12-member reconsiliation committee, Senator John Enoh retained the position of secretary. Amongst those in the December list which made the reconstituted committee were former Borno State governor, Sen. Kashim Shettima; sitting governors of Osun and Niger States, Gboyega Oyetola and Abubakar Sani Bello and Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor. The reconciliation committee to be inaugurated today (Tuesday) “is empowered to address grievances of party members across the country and resolve existing conflicts, all with a view to fostering oneness, strengthen the party for better governance and ensure unity of purpose within the party.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
