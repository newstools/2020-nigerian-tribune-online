As a way of strengthening health education in the country through their alma mater, graduates from the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Akoka, are planning to raise at least N7.5 billion among themselves, friends of the college and other philanthropists in the country. The amount, if realized, will be used to build a high standard research centre worth N2 billion, a teaching and administrative block worth N3 billion; to buy utility vehicles at a cost of N314 million, acquire various laboratory equipment at a cost of N226.4 million, provide Vevo 3100 live imaging platform at a cost of N265 million and expand Block M and Q of the college at a cost of N450 million, among others. A professor of Anatomy and chairman of the organising committee of the event, Oladapo Ashiru, made this disclosure at this year’s fundraising dinner of the group held in Lekki, Lagos, last Saturday. We need adequate and reliable baseline data to move forward… ASUU, management disagree over funding of Kano State… De Potter College of Health Technology warns matriculates… Your mentors shouldn’t come from entertainment industry… Among the high profile alumni of the college at the annual event, which was the second in the series, are the wife of the Lagos State governor, Mrs Joke Sanwo-Olu, who represented her husband as special guest of honour; the co-founder of Eko Hospital, Dr Olor’ogun Sunny Kuku; Professors Debo Adeyemi, Stephen Odaibo and Nimi Briggs. Speaking to newsmen on the sidelines of the event, Professor Ashiru said the provision of all the identified current needs of the 58-year-old college would not only boost the quality of knowledge and skills to be imparted on students and research activities, but would also stem the brain drain and medical tourism syndromes in the country. In their own separate chats also at the event, the college’s provost, Professor Afolabi Lesi and the national chairman of the alumni association, Dr Ajibayo Adeyeye, said apart from the money being raised through the dinner, the event also availed alumni opportunity to reunite after many years of graduation. The high point of the event was the presentation of recognition awards to some personalities, including Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Outstanding alumni awards to 24 notable members of the group, including Dr Olor’ogun Sunny Kuku; Professors Debo Adeyemi, Stephen Odaibo, Nimi Briggs, Ashiru Oladapo, Afolabi Lesi, Rowland Ndoma Egba, Lovett Lawson and  Banji Adewuyi.
