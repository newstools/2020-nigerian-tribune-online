The Nigerian Baptist Convention has sought the assistance of the international community in the violence in Nigeria and what the body described as “the ongoing persecution Christians are facing in the country. “ The church, in a statement made available to newsmen, said it was not happy with the way the Federal Government had been handling the security situation of the country in the past few years which it said has made Christians more vulnerable to constant attacks from Boko Haram and herdsmen. President of the Nigerian Baptist Convention and Christian Association of Nigeria, Reverend (Dr) Supo Ayokunle, who was reacting to the security situation in the country, condemned the attitude of the Federal Government to the rescue of Christians who are under the captivity of the Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in the country. A release signed by the Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Baptist Convention, Pastor Eben Durodola, said the Federal Government was not “doing enough to save lives of Christians that are being killed everyday by Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in Nigeria.” Ailing actor, Azuzu, never visited SCOAN Homeless man rescued by Osun governor’s wife arrives Nigeria… Thousands stranded, as Lagos okada ban takes effect Nigeria records fresh 95 cases of Lassa fever in one week Ayokunle, who expressed displeasure at the way the military and other security personnel are handling security situation in Nigeria, said if urgent and new method are not adopted, only God knows what will happen in the months to come. “I cannot continue to keep quiet when Christians are being killed, maimed and attacked on a daily basis without any justification while those who are expected to protect lives and property of citizen are not doing enough. “The chairman of Christian Association in Adamawa State who was murdered by Boko Haram could have been rescued if the Federal Government showed enough interest.
