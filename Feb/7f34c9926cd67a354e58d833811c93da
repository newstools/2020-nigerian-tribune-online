The residents of Yabo Local Government Area of Sokoto State, on Monday, offered a special prayer for the state governor, Rt Hon Aminu Tambuwal’s electoral victory at the Supreme Court victories. The prayers session was conducted at the Community’s Central Jummat Mosque and was attended by Islamic clerics, community leaders, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) bigwigs as well as the party supporters. The Chief Imam, Alhaji Lemo Faruk Yabo, who led other clerics, expressed gratitude to God for making Tambuwal’s victory at the election tribunal, Appeal Court and Supreme Court a success. The clerics also prayed to God to guide and protect the governor in the discharge of his duties as well as grant continuous peace and stability to the state and country at large. Speaking with journalists shortly, Deputy Speaker of Sokoto State House of Assembly, Hon Abubakar Magaji, said the leadership virtue exhibited by Tambuwal since the inception of his government had earned him wider support from people of the state, irrespective of their political affiliations.
