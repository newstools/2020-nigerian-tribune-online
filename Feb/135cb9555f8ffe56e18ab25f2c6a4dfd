THE Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Shina Olukolu, has revealed that the state police command is already recruiting volunteers into the IGP, Mohammed Adamu’s community policing initiative. Olukolu stated this on Friday during the inauguration of  administrative building donated to the Egbeda Divisional Police Headquarters by the CEO of Crime Alert Security Network, Mr Amos Gbenga Olaniyan, through  the Egbeda Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC). The police boss said those being recruited were between ages of 21 and 40, and that they must be respected members of the communities who are also gainfully employed. The police commissioner said the recruitment, which is being done at the local government level, with the support of the traditional rulers, would help boost the synergy between the police and members of the public, especially in the area of intelligence sharing, which will then lead to crime-free communities. Olukolu, thereafter, commended the gesture of Mr Olaniyan, saying the project would go a long way in making the work of policemen at Egbeda division easier. We didn’t endorse Ajimobi as deputy national chairman… Why I won’t interfere in Ganduje, Sanusi rift —Buhari Can I use skin lightening creams? My wife got the police to me; I was arrest locked up for… He said the IGP’s initiative, which is community policing, would help foster a common goal between the police and members of the public in the area of security. Olukolu then commended members of the Egbeda PCRC for their support to the police in their community, adding that it would make the policemen go the extra mile in the discharge of their duties. Earlier, the CEO of Crime Alert, Mr Olaniyan, said it is high time the police and other security agencies partnered with the private sector to improve security in the country. He said the government could not do everything alone “and that is why it is important the private sector is brought in board in order to tackle the security challenges facing the country.” Olaniyan also called on the Federal Government to embrace technology in order to overcome the country’s security problems. “The government must realise that technology will make everything we do easier, and we should not be suffering in silence when there are technologies that can make the work of our security agencies easier in busting crime.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
