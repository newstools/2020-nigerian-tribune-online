Manchester City’s top-flight triumph in 2014 could be chalked off if a Premier League investigation finds financial wrongdoing by the club, according to a report. An investigation by UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) has already led to City being banned from European competition for the next two seasons after the club allegedly overstated its sponsorship revenue. City are set to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after releasing a statement saying they were “disappointed but not surprised” by the ruling.

But City are still waiting for word from the Premier League, with the league set to conduct their own investigation into financial wrongdoing on City’s part. Should that investigation release similar findings to UEFA’s probe, Premier League rules allows a commission to deduct points retrospectively. UEFA’s CFCB ruled that City’s wrongdoing was committed between 2012 and 2016 and should the Premier League’s investigation follow suit, City’s 2014 triumph will be affected if points are to be taken away. Then-City manager Manuel Pellegrini led City to the title that year but Liverpool were firm favourites throughout much of the campaign, eventually losing out by two points. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has had his say on City’s European ban, showing his sympathy for Pep Guardiola and the City players who “did nothing wrong”. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
