Lagos State government warned on Wednesday that it will not tolerate the recklessness of truck drivers when transporting goods on the state roads as it would not allow the lives of Lagosians and visitors to be put at risk. The government gave the warning in a reaction to upsurge of number of trailers/tankers involved in major accidents on the expressways and major arteries in the state in the last three months, while it vowed to continue to encourage people to do business in Lagos. The state’s Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, said this in a statement made available to newsmen, disclosing that the Vehicle Inspection Services (VIS) had been directed to step up its activities in the government’s bid to stop such accidents involving trucks and others. “Lagos State will not tolerate the recklessness of truck drivers when transporting goods on our roads.

Omotoso said the state government was also curious about the persistence of tanker accidents at the Berger end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the resultant gridlock that trails the incidents, spiralling through the entire Ikeja axis of the State and traumatising motorists and commuters.

According to him, the two incidents left motorists and commuters stranded on the Expressway till the early hours of Wednesday. “The government sympathises with Lagosians on the discomfort resulting from the attitude of careless and reckless drivers travelling from the outskirts into Lagos,” he said, promising that the state government would continue to engage the Ogun State government as well as Federal Government agencies to identify the cause of the recurring Lagos-Ibadan Expressway accidents and fashion out solutions. He, however, said that the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) had been mandated to continue its support for Ogun State and Federal Government traffic and emergency management agencies by providing evacuation expertise and equipment for quick removal of vehicles involved in crashes on the Expressway. “Besides, the Lagos State government will commission an inquiry to ascertain that the accidents involving tankers and articulated vehicles, which seem to have developed a consistent pattern, are not deliberate acts of carnage. “Such accidents have consistently happened midweek, specifically on Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving traffic tailing onto the Third Mainland Bridge, Agidingbi, Ikeja and even Oregun, in many instances,” the commissioner said. “The Vehicle Inspection Service will step up its services to prevent issuance of Road Worthiness Certificates to undeserving vehicles, particularly trucks that are not fit to ply our roads. “While the Lagos State Government acknowledges the hardship caused by the reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway by the Federal Government, made more unbearable by the crude attitude of some articulated vehicle drivers, it will continue to engage stakeholders at all levels to explore ways of addressing the thorny issues until an enduring solution is found to the menace of truck and tanker accidents on our highways,” he added.
