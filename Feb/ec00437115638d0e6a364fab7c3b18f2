The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) has said that since the Federal Government has failed in its primary assignment of securing lives and property, Nigerians should rise up to defend themselves. Pereotubo Oweilaemi, Esq., President, IYC worldwide, made the call in a statement made available journalists on Saturday in Warri, Delta State. “The growing insecurities across the country is a clear indication of system failure. “The central government has failed in its primary responsibility of securing lives and property in the country. “The people in power at the centre has lost control of the system. “Nigerians in the circumstance need to look for alternative measures to secure their lives. “No place is safe in the country because the centre is no longer holding the ace.

Security is everybody’s business. “It has come to a point where all hands need to be on deck to solve this intractable conundrum. “We condemn the gruesome murder of the CAN Chairman, Adamawa Branch in cold blood. We join CAN and other well-meaning Nigerians to call the government to stop the serial killings across the country. “President Buhari should also heed to the voice of reason to overhaul his redundant service chiefs. “The lopsided composition of the security structures in the government and their lack of will the confront the present quagmire is the cause of the rising insecurities,” he said.
