You recently featured on Dj Hazan’s new street single, “No Drama” how did you pull that off? I and the “undisputed” DJ Hazan have known each other from way back, our relationship has been a very cordial one from a long time ago. While we have tried to work on a few projects for sometime but we didn’t get to work because of time and engagements here and there but I knew that working with him was imminent. It was all about right timing. DJ Hazan wanted to put out a single and told me it was about time to put me on it, so that’s how the song,  “No Drama “came up. It was as a result of a certain negative experience I had in the club few days before DJ Hazan reached out to me to jump on his work. It was a nice experience and one that I would not forget in a hurry. The song was produced by Hottunez beatz.  You are an Alternative/Afro fusion act, what exactly does your genre mean? Afro fusion is an umbrella term for music made in West Africa mostly Nigeria because of the infusion. It is about the ability to infuse native languages or slangs into whatever music genre you want to adopt as your style. I am a versatile singer and I can always go with any flow but the Afro fusion is my kind of song that keeps me going and helps me to discover myself more as a music act.  At what stage in your life did you pick total interest in music? Firstly, I come from a family where everyone is a music lover to the core. I should add that growing up in FESTAC town, Lagos State also shaped my music career and background. You know that FESTAC is regarded as the home of entertainment.  My interest in music was formed by the fact that I grew up in an environment where entertainment is a common denominator for the people. The area has so many renowned music artistes to its name who also grew up there.  Who are the prominent artistes that emerged from FESTAC? Let me just mention a few of them: You have the legendary 2baba, Tony Tetuila and of course, foremost rapper, Ycee.  So, I picked total interest in music at age of 16, when I was enrolled into a music school by my mom, “Ten Strings Musical Institute”, where I learnt music rudiments among other valuable aspects of music.  You are still new on the bloc and you may have a lot of work in your hands. How are you going to deliver on the expectations from you?

My swollen feet For me, hard work and consistency are two key components that must be part of your craft as you aim to go higher. Even as a business man or woman, how consistent and hardworking you are will determine how far you will go on the job. So, for me, staying ahead of others and working hard with the help of God, the journey will be fruitful and rewarding  We have not heard much about you; from the look of things you have been quite silent, what is responsible for that? When you are working, you don’t come out to announce that you are working. It is better to work in silence with your team and let the success make the noise for you. As I speak with you,my team and I are currently working on a lot of things . We are currently spreading the gospel of Boi George to the world. The silence you noticed for me is the work in progress .  Music industry is filled with many talented acts that are making waves, how do you intend to make a name for yourself? I believe the world is big enough to accommodate everybody just like the sky is big enough to accommodate all birds that dare to fly. From a young age, I had known that there will always be a space for anyone who believes in his or herself. On top of that, you must work hard. I believe in myself and I know the Boi George gospel is gonna spread soonest.  What’s the latest project on your table now and what is your biggest plan? I and my team have a lot of plans for this year but the biggest or major one is to drop a body of work sometime this year by God’s grace. An elongated playlist (Ep) which will make a lot of people understand my sound better.  Are you saying people don’t understand your sound yet? I think the sound is good and the people are really falling in love with my tune. The people will understand the sound better, sooner or later. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
