I want to commend the Nigerian Army for responding quickly to the villagers’ distress call and by extension, calls by Nigerians that they should intensify the fight against insurgency. “Other army formations have been given the order not only to repel the insurgents but to take the fight to the operational base of the insurgents. “That is what also happened in Askira Uba last week when the insurgents went there to attack the people.
