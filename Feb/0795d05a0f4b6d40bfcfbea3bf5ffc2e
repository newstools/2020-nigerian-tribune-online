Oja Oba/ Mapo Court C  Customary Court, Mapo, Ibadan, Oyo State has dissolved the eight-year-old wedlock between a man, Taofeek Olarenwaju and his wife, Mariam Olanrewaju. Taofeek who filed a divorce suit against his wife accused her of being troublesome, disobedient and uncaring. The plaintiff added that he was always afraid of going home after work because the defendant had made their home unwelcoming for him. Mariam admitted to claim stating that he had failed in his responsibilities towards her and their only child. The court president, Chief Ademola Odunade after he had heard both parties observed that their union had broken down irretrievably.

I ensure they are comfortable and that their needs are met on regular basis but all I get in return for these are harsh and unfriendly attitude from my wife.

She flouts my order at will. “He addresses me rudely and threatens me all the time. My lord, I always dread going home after working hours because Mariam is a trouble maker and would always find an opportunity to fight me. “I left the house for Mariam because I didn’t want her to push me into committing crime. “I pray this honourable court to separate us today,” he stated “My lord, all my husband said are lies,” Mariam told the court. “I never threatened my husband neither did I make our home inhabitable for him. “Taofeek has failed to take care of me and our only child. He doesn’t care to know how we survive each day. “I lent my husband some money out of the capital from my business but he failed to pay back. “My lord, all the reasons my husband gave for wanting to divorce me are flimsy excuses. He dragged me to court because he had a misunderstanding with my first child who I had for another man, but brought along with me when he married me. “The child has moved out of our home in order for peace to reign but Taofeek obviously remains not pacified,” she concluded.
