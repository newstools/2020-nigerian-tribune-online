In spite of the competition, many remain defiant and hopeful that they would get the big break, especially when signs look promising through early reception of their works by music lovers. One such talent who seems to be worming his way into the hearts of music lovers in the country and beyond is Ugo. The Imo State-born artiste, who claimed to have been influenced by Snoop Dog, Celine Dion and Michael Jackson, recently released a track ‘Life is banana’ and the song is already getting reviews.
