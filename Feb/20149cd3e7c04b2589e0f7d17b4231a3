Founder/General Overseer, World Evangelism Bible Church (WEBIC), Lagos State, Prophet Samson Ayorinde, has urged the presidency to do more in securing the country. Ayorinde made this known during a special service last Sunday at his church heaquarters, just as he lamented the spate of violent crimes such as kidnapping and several attacks of Christians. According to him,  “insecurity scares away foreign investors who are needed to lift our economy.” He commended governors of the South-West states for putting in place a security outfit, Operation Amotekun, which he said would aid crime prevention in the region. Ayorinde also joined world leaders in appealing to the United States and Iran to avoid plunging the world into another world war. ‘2.5 million Northern children endangered by malnutrition’ Buhari has breached Armed Forces Act in retaining service… Lawyers divided over de-registration of 74 parties Amotekun personnel to carry licensed firearms —South-West… He, however, urged leaders of the two countries to de-escalate the crisis so as to ease tension in the region, just as he noted that the global economy cannot withstand crisis. He also revealed that efforts are ongoing in  the repositioning of the church, saying that “WEBIC will be 25 this year and there is the need to reposition the church in order to boost ministry. Towards the process, the church has set up many committees including finance, building, evangelism and administration, and  the committees will midwife the 25th Mantle (Convention) coming up in November.” He noted  that since WEBIC is renowned for evangelism, the development  would be pursued vigorously. “The repositioning   will also invlove the reorganisation of executives of the various units of the church,” he added.
