The Adamawa State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) is set to approach the Supreme Court for judicial review of the court’s verdict on the last governorship election which favoured the Peoples Democracy Party (PDP) in the state. While confirming the development to our reporter, the party’s legal adviser, Barr Shagnah Pwamaddi Maboyofe, said all arrangements have been concluded to seek for a review of the judgement. According to him, the party in the state is ready to approach the Apex Court for a judicial review to set aside the judgement delivered on the Adamawa State governorship appeal between the APC and PDP and two others. He said the major grounds of appeal are whether in view of the earlier judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Hope Uzodinma & one other and Emeka Ihedioha & others in the Imo governorship, the appellants were bound to call unit by unit agents as witnesses to prove a petition that is strictly on overvoting with documentary evidence.

He revealed that it is on these grounds that the APC in Adamawa are heading to Supreme Court to seek judicial redress on the recent appeal judgment in favour of the ruling PDP in the state. Giving more clarity on the plans by the state APC on their new plans to engage into another legal tussle, Ahmed Lawan, state organising secretary of the party affirmed what the party’s legal adviser said, asserting that they are not satisfied with the last judgment passed by the Supreme Court. According to him, Imo State has since gone to Supreme Court for judicial review, while states of Zamfara, Bauchi, Kano and Sokoto are planning to approach the Apex Court for judicial review, Adamawa State should not be left behind.
