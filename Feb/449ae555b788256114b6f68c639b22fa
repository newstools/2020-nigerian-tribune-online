The House of Representatives on Thursday called on National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to prosecute all the people arrested in connection with the use of paracetamol to sterilize meat and bleach to process cassava in Osun state. The resolution was passed following the adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon. Dozie Nwankwo. In his lead debate, Hon. Dozie stated that the practice of using bleach and paracetamol on food products is highly detrimental to human health. He also urged the Federal Ministry of Health to ensure a blueprint for practices in the public food sector is available to the public for implementation. “The House notes with dismay the revelation by Osun State government officials that some caterers and food vendors in the State have been using paracetamol and bleach to tenderize meat and process cassava.
