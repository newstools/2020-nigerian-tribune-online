Benue State government has finalised plans to demote 37 secondary school principals over examination malpractices which led to the delisting of their schools from external examinations. The State Commissioner for Education, Professor Dennis Ityavyar, who disclosed this to newsmen, said that the West African Examination Council (WAEC) had de-recognised 37 secondary schools in the state for examination malpractices. The Commissioner said despite that 164 schools in the state were involved in one form of malpractice or the other, the 37 that were de-recognised were the schools that were neck-deep in malpractice.

The 38th school, according to the commissioner was not de-recognised by the examination body but identified with some practices in the school, hence the decision of the government to sanction the principal of the school, to serve as a deterrent to others. Prof. Ityavyar also noted that the state government had put in place, modalities to restore order in the education system in the state and would not spare anyone that toys with it. He noted that because of the value government places on the education system, it ploughed a lot of resources into the sector for the construction and renovation of classrooms in the state.
