A serving member of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC), Mr Samuel Adigun, and eight others have been kidnapped by some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers in army uniforms near Idu village, along the Abuja-Lokoja road. Information available to Tribune Online on Monday said the incident happened last week Thursday. It was gathered that the corps member who is serving with Abaji area council secretariat boarded a bus to Lokoja from Abaji when he was kidnapped alongside other eight passengers. A resident of Idu village who preferred anonymity said that the incident happened last Thursday afternoon after the gunmen wearing army uniforms with sophisticated weapons emerged from the bush. “The gunmen suddenly shot the tyres of the unmarked Toyota commuter bus and forced the driver to stop.

Meanwhile, a senior staff with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who preferred anonymity, confirmed the abduction of the corps member, saying contact has since been established with kidnappers as negotiations were ongoing. “Even as I am not in a position to speak to the press about the incident, a contact has since been established with kidnappers, which we are hoping that the victim would be set free either today or tomorrow,” he said. Meanwhile, all effort to speak with the spokesman of the Kogi State Police Command, DSP Williams Aya, proved abortive as calls put to his line were not connecting as at the time of filing the report.
