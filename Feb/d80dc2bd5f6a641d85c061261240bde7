A coalition of West Students’ Leaders in Kogi State has urged the member representing Yagba Federal Constituency of Kogi State, Hon Leke Abejide, to extend his ‘free WAEC Payment’ Support programme to all local government areas in the senatorial districts. The coalition in a statement, made available to newsmen in Abuja on Tuesday by the National President of National Association of Okun Students, Comrade Seun Bello, said such educational support scheme was urgently needed in Kogi West Senatorial District of the State. Bello urged the federal lawmaker to expand the coverage of his education support scheme from four LGAs that made up the constituency to seven LGAs that constitute Kogi West. He said that though Ajibade is representing a Federal Constituency, the call became imperative following the economic hardship in the state affecting parents in the senatorial district of the state from sponsoring their wards to secondary school level.

According to the Coalition, “considering the dilapidated, obsolete and unaffordable educational system in our dear state and poor Students’ welfare scheme, with little or no impact, it has become imperative to applaud the recent robust commitment of over N72 million by Abejide into Educational development in Yagba Federal Constituency.’’ Bello also urged other lawmakers and elected officers in the state, especially Kogi West Senatorial districts to emulate Abejide, in initiating more education support/ Students’ welfare initiative. “We also urge Kogi State and Federal Government to intensify and give more consideration to Educational, Entrepreneurial and ICT development in the implementation of the year budget, to aid affordable/quality education and effective Students’ welfare support. Bello said it was no longer news that many philanthropists, community leaders and public office holders no longer show commitment toward the genuine and noble cause of the students. Bello, however, said that history would never forget the few ones who had consistently been showing commitments to community development and human development in general. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
