An Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama, Jos, on Thursday sentenced a 19-year-old mechanic, Alhassan Mohammed, to a total of 23 months in prison for stealing and assaulting. The Judge, Lawal Suleiman, sentenced Mohammed to 18 months for stealing and five months for assaulting a minor. Suleiman, however, gave the accused an option to pay a fine of N20,000 for 18 months imprisonment, but none for the five months sentence. He also ordered the convict to pay a compensation of N8,000 to the complainant, saying that the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such criminal acts.
