African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) will hold its Senior Policy Seminar (SPS) between March 9 and 10, 2020 at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja. The event is hosted in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the CBN Governor, Dr Godwin Emefiele will deliver the keynote address. AERC’s annual Senior Policy Seminar is unique bringing together senior policymakers from sub-Saharan African countries together with economic researchers to share knowledge and debate on urgent policy issues relating to the sustainable development of African economies. This year, the focus is Agriculture and Food Policies for Nutrition in Africa, addressing agricultural growth patterns, the burden of malnutrition, diet diversities, climate smart agricultural practices, market access, food security and the effect of agriculture on health and nutrition. Since 2016, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, AERC has implemented a number of research activities under the Analysis of the Impact of Agricultural, Food and Nutrition Policies on Nutrition Outcomes in Africa (AFPON) programme. This research is aimed at linking agricultural policies to various nutrition outcomes such as stunting, wasting, anaemia, child mortality, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity and malnutrition.

Dr Innocent Matshe, AERC’s Director of Training stated that the seminar was going to be highly impactful for all participants. “The importance of agriculture and food policies towards positive nutrition outcomes for all Africans is vital to sustain and grow economies as we move into a new decade,” he said. “With our unique approach of bringing topic-matter research experts in the field of agriculture and nutrition together with senior policymakers across the continent, we believe the discussions and debates will help countries across the region begin to implement policies to foster and support this sector, and to help policymakers learn from each other through shared knowledge around policy successes and failures,” Dr Matshe added. The two-day seminar will feature four synthesis papers and a policy roundtable discussion featuring noted researchers and policymakers, globally. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
