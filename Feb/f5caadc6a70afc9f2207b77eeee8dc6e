The Kano State government said, in its effort to enhance cheap and easy transportation system in the state, it has resolved to move ahead with the Metroline Train System but with a reduction in cost from N1.8 billion to N700 million. This is just as the state government further revealed it plans to introduce a modern integrated transportation system in the state metropolis. The state commissioner for works and infrastructure, Alhaji Mu’azu Magaji, disclosed this on Monday while speaking with pressmen. It would be recalled that there was a plan for a light rail which would cost about N1.8billion and the loan generated controversy in Kano which led to the suspension of the project. According to him, the proposal was in line with the Governor Ganduje’s vision and determination to transform Kano city into a world-class city which will be conducive, functional and attractive to investors from around the world.

And in the next two years, Kano will have a modern transport system like you see in modern cities across the world.” Alhaji Magaji, however, disclosed that apart from the integration of the light rail and the BRT, the plan also includes the development of seven terminals across the suburb of the city. He then revealed that at every 10 kilometres outside Kano along Zaria road, Hadejia road, Maiduguri road, Katsina road, Gwarzo road and the rest, there will be a terminal outside the city which is located at a very critical point where the major entry goes into the city.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
