While addressing the South-West caucus leadership, Aribasoye said, “the reason for our protest is for equity and justice. The position of the national deputy chairman APC south became vacant upon the appointment of Niyi Adebayo who is now a minister. “By the precedent convention and constitution of our party, the state which produces the seat that is vacant is to select another person to replace.” According to him, “in Lagos State, Muiz Banire as the chairman of Assets Management Company of Nigeria and was replaced by Babatunde Ogala which is also from Lagos. Like in Kwara State, Lai Mohammed was appointed minister, Professor Bolaji Abdullahi replaced him. We have the same in River State, in the case of Oji Ngofa. “There is a zoning arrangement within our party, whereby the national chairman was zoned to Edo State in South-South then the deputy national chairman, the south was zoned to South West and Ekiti. Now that the position is vacant it beckons on the South-West caucus to ask for nomination from Ekiti state, not any other place. But what we heard they want to choose a replacement from Oyo State.” “Ekiti State is not an appendage of any other state. We are against cheating. What belongs to us must not be taken away. The position of the National Deputy Chairman (South) of the APC should be zoned back to Ekiti. We believe in a course and we are resolute. We are resisting modern-day Ajele.” Responding to the protesters, the national Vice-chairman (Southwest) of the APC), Pastor Bankole Oluwajana, implored them to be calm, saying “we have heard what you have said, and we will make it known the leadership of the party.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
