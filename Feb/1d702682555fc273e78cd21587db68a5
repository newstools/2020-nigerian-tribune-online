The  Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has described the new tax regime of an increase in Value Added Tax (VAT)  to 7.5 percent from 5 percent, as capable of putting  more pressure on the Nigerian consumer. Making this observation at a media briefing , in Lagos, recently,  the President of the Chamber, Mrs. Toki Mabogunje, stated that though the new tax regime, scheduled to start from February 1, this year, is aimed at generating more revenue for government and making business environment more enabling,  it might not help the cause of manufacturers and stakeholders in the real sector of the economy. According to her, the new tax regime would affect cost of production, impact negatively on profit margin, as well as put the consumers on the edge.
