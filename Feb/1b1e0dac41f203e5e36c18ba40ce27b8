ABOUT seven people are standing trial before the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) family court for various child abuse offences. Director, Gender Department, Social Development Secretariat (SDS), Dr Agnes Hart, who disclosed this while interrogating some guardians alleged to have assaulted minors in their care, expressed worry over the increasing rate of the incident in the territory. She said the department entertains an average of four assault cases every week. Dr Hart warned that the full weight of the law would be applied to anyone found guilty of abusing other people, especially children, saying the FCT administration has zero-tolerance for any form of abuse on any resident.
