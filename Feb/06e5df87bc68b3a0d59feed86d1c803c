Organised labour in Niger on Friday said that the ongoing strike embarked upon on February 4 would continue until its demands are met by the state government. This was contained in a statement jointly signed by Mr Yakubu Garba, chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and his Trade Union Congress (TUC) counterpart, Yunusa Tanimu in Minna. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the NLC and TUC had directed their members to embark on an indefinite strike over non-implementation of the new national minimum wage and other entitlements. According to the statement, “negotiations between organised labour and the government of Niger State is yet to achieve any tangible result. “Nigerlites are enjoined to ignore rumours by mischief-makers and agents of falsehood publishing otherwise and await further updates/directives from the organised labour. “Civil servants are urged to remain calm and prayerful as negotiations continue. Industrial unions are to continue to liaise with the labour centres (NLC/TUC) in Niger state to ensure full mobilisation.

NAN reports that part of the demands of labour included the immediate implementation of the N30,000 national minimum wage, its consequential adjustment and accrued arrears to all categories of workers both at the state and local government levels. It also called for the immediate resumption of payment of outstanding annual leave grant for 2019 to deserving workers at both state and local government level as well as a clear commitment from the state government on pension policy in the interest of workers. Efforts by NAN to get the reaction of state Head of Service, Hajiya Salamatu Abubakar, on the matter was not successful. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
