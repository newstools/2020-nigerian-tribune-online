THE management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has appealed to its numerous customers to pay their electricity bills, saying the sum of N1.2 billion uncollectible bills for the month of January 2020, is seriously affecting the organisation. This was contained in a statement signed and issued by Head, Corporate Communication, KEDCO, Alhaji Ibrahim Sani Shawai. A copy of the statement made available to pressmen in Kano said the management stressed that such huge debt at the beginning of the year was not good for the growth of power distribution in the Kano, Jigawa and Katsina States. According to the management, all efforts must be made by stakeholders to ensure that no party suffers as the N1.2billion debt did not give a sign of the needed cooperation that KEDCO has always sought from the customers.

In business money is key and when we cannot get back our investment in terms of service rendered, it has a way of bringing down morale. “But we remain resolute and committed to our responsibilities while seeking more understanding from our customers so we can also fulfil our own part of the commitment to relevant stakeholders who transmit power to us.’’ The Kano Disco boss also called on all customers who may have issues with the new cashless payment platform made available to meet any of KEDCO staff for speedy resolution or assistance on how to pay their bills online or through other cashless means.
