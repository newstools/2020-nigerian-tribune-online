It was also gathered that the trucks were impounded for disobeying the order by the Federal Government over the closure of the border by security operatives. It will be recalled that the Federal Government closed the border in August last year and ordered the restriction of movement of petroleum product beyond 20 kilometers of its various borderland across Nigeria. “We want our members to take note of this and also to assure them that necessary steps are ongoing between government and stakeholders to resolve the issue,” the release said.
