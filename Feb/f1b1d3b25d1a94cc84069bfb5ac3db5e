THE Chief Imam of Lagos State, Sheikh Sulaimon Abou-Nolla, has called on government at all levels to be alive to the responsibility of ensuring the safety of lives and properties of Nigerians. The cleric described the level of insecurity in the country presently as alarming. Sheikh Abou-Nolla, in a statement personally signed by him, said the spate of crimes and general insecurity in the country was worrisome and, therefore, called for concerted effort to urgently address the “ugly” trend. He urged religious leaders to avoid heating up the polity and work hand in hand with the government to expose perpetrators of crime. His statement reads in part: “Drastic measures need to be taken to ensure that the country does not turn into a banana republic. Government at all levels must be alive to their responsibilities. “Insecurity is becoming alarming. Hardly will any day pass that we will not read about kidnapping, killing, robbery, among others, in the national dailies. We cannot continue like this if we still want to be respected among the comity of nations.
