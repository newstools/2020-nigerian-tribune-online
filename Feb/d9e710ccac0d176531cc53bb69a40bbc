The Senate has expressed concern over lack of proactive measures by appropriate government health institutions and agencies to ward off the global scourge of coronavirus. At the plenary on Thursday, it mandated its Committees on Primary Healthcare and Health to open discussions with the Federal Ministry of Health to ensure that precautionary measures were put in place to prevent the pandemic from spreading to Nigeria. President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan also suggested that travellers from China be quarantined. He said: “We must be prepared. We must take all the necessary measures at our ports: airports, seaports. If someone is coming from China, he should be quarantined, not self-isolation. “I want to urge the committees on Primary Healthcare and Health to engage with the Federal Ministry of Health once again, We want to see every possible effort done in our airports or seaport.

But I arrived yesterday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe airport and there was no screening. “All we were given is a sheet of paper to indicate whether we were sick and whether we have been to one country or the other and how we will be contacted if there is an emergency. How will you trail me? How do you know if I have fallen sick? This is very frightening. “Something has to be done to ensure that we do not give way to a situation which we will not be able to control.
