He said most of the comments were very useful and would be compiled and forwarded to the House of Assembly. Fapohunda said the majority of the comments received were on provisions relating to accountability and transparency in the administration of Amotekun Corps. According to him, “There were lots of comments on the Independent Complaints Mechanism and the internal review process. We will certainly consider proposals for additional measures to prevent abuse of power and rights violations if those on the Bill are inadequate. “I am however of the opinion that measures contained in the Bill are sufficient. If the course of implementation issues arise, we will respond promptly. Our overriding consideration is public confidence in the Agency”. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
