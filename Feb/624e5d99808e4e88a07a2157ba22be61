The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday said that Nigerians should hold the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) responsible for the negative impacts of the proposed travel sanctions imposed on the country by the United States America. In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by its National Publicity Secretary. Mr Kola Ologbodiyan, the party described the sanction as yet another huge misfortune brought by the Buhari Presidency and the APC which have continued to wreck the nation with its compromised handling of security issues, in addition to escalated bloodletting and human rights violation under their watch. The party lamented that the travel ban would have grave consequences on economic, educational, and healthcare opportunities; hurt family and social ties as well as further put pressure on the nation’s overall national economy. According to the statement, “more depressing is that the APC and the Buhari Presidency have been reversing diplomatic gains achieved by previous administrations while gradually pitching our nation against other countries of the world with its poor record on security, corruption and human right issues. “Our party is worried that our nation that, has become a global destination and investment hub under the PDP, is now being pushed back to a pariah status under the incompetent and divisive APC, as reports from other members of the international community, including credible international organisations, have continued to raise concerns on security and human right issues under the Buhari administration. “Only recently, our nation was rated as the third country with the highest level of terrorism in 2019 after Iran and Afghanistan, in the Global Terrorism Index rating by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP).

The party, however, called on the United States to “ensure that the ban does not hurt innocent Nigerians who are also bearing the brunt of the poor handling of security in our country under the APC administration.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
