Hundreds of severe weather warnings were in place across Britain on Sunday as heavy winds and rains continued to sweep across the region, causing dangerous flooding and travel chaos. Storm Dennis was bringing prolonged periods of rain to southern Scotland, where authorities issued evacuation orders to residents. Meanwhile, in South Wales, the Met Office issued a red alert and described the situation as “life-threatening.” According to dpa, the Taff River in Wales burst its banks overnight, flooding parts of the town of Pontypridd, about 20 kilometres north of Cardiff.
