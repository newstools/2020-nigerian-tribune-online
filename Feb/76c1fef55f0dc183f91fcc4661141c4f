The National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (retd), has alleged the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, of dabbling into national security matters. The NSA had, in a circular from his office, according to PREMIUM TIMES, accused Kyari of hijacking the coordination of security leadership and outright sidelining in the scheme of things on national security operations. The circular revealed that Kyari, contrary to protocols and in a situation akin to acting in the capacity of the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, convenes and chairs meetings with heads of defence, security and intelligence agencies with their supervising ministers in attendance. PREMIUM TIMES reported that, “the memo, however, speaks of Buhari’s seeming inability to control his appointees as several open confrontations had broken out among his senior aides for the most part of his five years in office.” Kyari and two presidential spokespersons, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu, did not return requests for comments about the memo Monday afternoon. Part of the letter read: “References A and B were sent in response to the request for Presidential intervention to sustain Internal Security operations of the police within the shortest possible time. However, the contents of the two references were in variance with Mr President’s verbal directives. Consequently, ONSA scrutinised the documents further and sought clarification from Mr President who has directed that Reference B be disregarded by all parties as it was sent without his endorsement.

For clarification, other than direct verbal directives from the President, written directives emanating from Mr President would be conveyed with a copy of his manuscript directive or at minimum, bear his signature.

It should be noted that the Chief of Staff to the President does not direct the security apparatus of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, his job as it relates to security stops at conveying Mr President’s written directives. “Similarly, you are reminded that the Chief of Staff to the President is not a presiding head of security, neither is he sworn in an oath of defending the country. As such, unprofessional practices such as presiding over meetings with service chiefs and heads of security organizations, as well as ambassadors and high commissioners to the exclusion of the NSA and/or supervising ministers are a violation of the constitution and directly undermine the authority of Mr President. Such acts and continuous meddlesomeness by the Chief of Staff have not only ruptured our security and defence efforts, but have slowed down any meaningful gain that Mr President has sought to achieve.” “As professionals, you are aware that the security of the Federal Republic of Nigeria requires concerted and centralised effort taking into account internal, external and diplomatic factors. It is, therefore, detrimental to our collective security that the Chief of Staff, who is only a supervising minister, holds meetings with diplomats, security chiefs and heads of agencies. “Pursuant to the foregoing, you are by this letter directed to desist from these illegal acts that serve nothing but the continuous undermining of our national security framework. Any breach-of this directive will attract the displeasure of Mr President.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
