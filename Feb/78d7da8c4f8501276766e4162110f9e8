The immediate past governor of Bayelsa State, Honourable Henry Seriake Dickson, has said that he left the Creek Haven Government House, Yenagoa, a fulfilled man. The former governor said in a statement by his media aide, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, that it was to the glory of God that he left Government House in a blaze of glory in spite of the shocking array of political forces who turned against him despite the assistance he rendered to them. He lamented that the security of Bayelsa was outsourced to criminal elements who unleashed an orgy of violence on the state since 2015.
