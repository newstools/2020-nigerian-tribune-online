A group, known as Yoka Indigenes in diaspora, has organised a free Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board  (JAMB) preparatory class for the indigenes of Takum local government area of Taraba State. Speaking at the programme, a Member of the group, Asst Controller General of Prisons (rtd) (Now Correctional Service), Ekijere Aken Shidi, said that the JAMB class was aimed at enhancing the chances of passing the exam with good points that will qualify the prospective candidates to the University of their choice. He explained that the education growth of the area was in the heart of the group and that was why they galvanised resources to ensure that younger generations have access to the requisite knowledge they needed to get admitted into higher institutions.
