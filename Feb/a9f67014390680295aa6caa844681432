THE National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has constituted a team of staff members to proceed on the first official assignment to be carried out by the fourth board of the commission. According to a statement by the head of Public Affairs of the commission, Hajiya Fatima Sanda Usara, the pre-hajj team is charged with making necessary accommodation and feeding arrangements in Saudi Arabia for this year’s hajj. Inaugurating the team on Wednesday, NAHCON chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Hassan, implored members of the team to show dedication in their assignment and make effort to examine all prospects towards ensuring that hajj fare goes down this year and hopefully goes further down next year. He emphasised that dedication is critical to addressing the issue of hajj fare reduction, a promise he made during screening of the board and one which, he said, he was determined to keep. The NAHCON chairman called on members of the team to carry out the assignment without compromising quality or standard of accommodation or feeding for pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.

According to Hassan, the task is not going to be easy but it is one they must do to avoid temptation, compromise and lure of surrender. The Commissioner, Operations, Alhaji Abdullahi Magari Hardawa, assured the chairman of the members’ commitment to meeting the expectations of the board and other Muslims as regards hajj fare reduction. He urged the members of the pre-hajj team to make good bargains that would enable pilgrims to embark on hajj with relative ease and get value for their money. The team, which will be led by Alhaji Hassan, comprises three permanent commissioners, senior management staff, members and workers from relevant departments. A member of the team, Hajiya Zainab Ujudud Sheriff, a pharmacist, is expected to inspect likely locations to site Nigerian clinics as well as ascertain that all conditions set by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for setting up clinics by participating countries are met.
