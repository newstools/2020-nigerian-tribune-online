The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has assured Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) of its readiness to oppose any bill that seeks to shrink the democratic space. Receiving members of the civil society groups led by Samson Itodo of YAGA Africa on an advocacy campaign against some controversial Bills before the National Assembly, the Executive Secretary of the Commission, Tony Ojukwu said, the Commission is mandated by law to review legislation to ensure that such are in consonance with human rights principles. ”We shall not shy away from collaborating with relevant stakeholders to campaign against any bill that infringes on the fundamental rights of the citizens,” he said Ojukwu told the leaders of CSOs, comprising of OSIWA, Yaga Africa, Amnesty International that public outcry against the Civil Society Regulatory Bill is overwhelming and as such should be subjected to the public hearing so that the interest of the people will be served.

The Executive Secretary, therefore, urged the CSOs not to relent in their advocacy and sensitization efforts particularly on those issues that affect the freedom and dignity of the people. Regulatory Bill, Social media and Hate speech will make a whole lot of difference as everyone including the legislators will begin to appreciate the need to avoid making laws. that will negate human rights and democratic principles. Ojukwu restated that any law put in place to reduce the enjoyment of human rights has no place in modern society and therefore must be struck out for lacking in respect for human rights. Earlier, the leader of the delegation, Mr Samson Itodo expressed fears that unless the Commission intervenes, the legislators may succeed in passing certain laws that may shrink the democratic space, gag the CSOs, the press and silence free speech. He charged the Commission to, as a matter of responsibility, issue an advisory to the National Assembly reminding the government of the implications of passing laws that are inconsistent with the Constitution and anti-human rights.
