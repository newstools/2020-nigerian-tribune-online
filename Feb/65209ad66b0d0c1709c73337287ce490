He said that the passing out parade was the peak of months of intensive and extensive military training and grooming of the cadets, in preparation for their challenging and exciting career as operatives of the commission. The acting chairman said that EFCC was training officers who could not be intimidated by challenges, discouraged by threats or defeated by any obstacle that might come their ways in the course of their career. “Corruption is a mountain and it can only be broken by prepared men and women of valour and virtues, as everything that went into the training of the graduating cadets was necessary for their fitness. “Nigeria shall never be corrupted because we will not give up and we will not surrender to the forces of darkness and greed in our midst,” he said. Magu promised that the commission would never relent in its efforts to rid Nigeria of all forms of corrupt practices. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
