The Lagos State government has denounced the reported suspected case of coronavirus in Lagos, saying there is no confirmed case of the dreaded disease in the state. The Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, who disclosed this Thursday morning in a release, said “Lagos State Government has affirmed that the Chinese citizen presented at the Reddington Hospital, Ikeja yesterday on suspicion of being infected with coronavirus has tested negative. Prof Abayomi noted that “the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in this particular patient was very low, and the conclusion of investigations and sophisticated testing confirmed that no case of Coronavirus exists in Lagos State till date.” Health minister announces first confirmed case of… Coronavirus: FG releases N386m to prevent importation to… Antimalarial drug has curative effect on coronavirus,… Stanbic IBTC set to share insights at Social Media Week 2020 ALSO READ: BREAKING: Coronavirus scare in Lagos, govt announces test result on Chinese citizen While giving details of the investigations, Abayomi explained that “the Ministry of Health’s attention was drawn to a suspected case of Coronavirus at Reddington Hospital, a private health facility located at Ikeja but from our investigations, we gathered that a Chinese citizen who arrived Nigeria from China seven weeks ago was presented at Reddington Hospital yesterday (Wednesday) complaining about fever. “The hospital, in keeping with the advisory we earlier issued, correctly maintained a high index of suspicion, isolated the patient and reported the case to the Ministry. “We took up the case, transferred the patient to the State Isolation Unit at the Mainland hospital which is our specialised infectious disease hospital. His blood samples were taken to the Virology laboratory for analysis and it came out negative.” Prof Abayomi, however, appealed to citizens to refrain from posting unverified news that could cause unnecessary anxiety in the community and urged residents to disregard any information about the novel Coronavirus that does not emanate from official communication channels of the Ministry of Health or his office.
