A bill seeking the establishment of a model and modern Technical Federal College of Education (FCE) in Michika, Adamawa State has passed the first reading at the Senate. The Senator Ishaku Abbo who sponsored the bill said Michika is the second-largest local government areas in the state and one of the many areas in North-East Nigeria that was captured by Boko Haram in 2014. According to him, it’s the first step toward establishing a model high institution of education in Michika that will help in fighting the scourge of insurgency.
