So it is befitting now that he is deceased, that the Commission, under the directive of the honourable minister of communication, under the directive of the President and commander-in-chief of the federation, Muhammdu Buhari, to come and condole the family of the late Alh Mukhtari Zimit. “The board will decide on what it will do to immortalise him, I don’t want to preempt on that.” He further stated that the board of the Nigerian Communication Commission has that tradition of giving a donation to families of the deceased and it’s being done in this case with the donation of N2m. “As you are aware the board is the policy organ of the Nigerian Communication Commission. So all the transformation you have seen in the Nigerian Communication Commission over the past 20 years were as a result of the hard work that the board of the NCC put in place during the tenure of Mukhtari Zimit. “Indeed the commission has lost a very dear friend and a very important personality who saw and participated in the important part that culminated in the culmination of the communication industry in general in the country.
