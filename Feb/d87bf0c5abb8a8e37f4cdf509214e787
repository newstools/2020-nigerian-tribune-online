Wife of a slain police corporal, Blessing Idoko, has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to give her employment that would sustain her and her 4-year-old son. The deceased corporal, Sunday Idoko, was shot dead by suspected gunmen while escorting election result from Ipokia to Ilaro collation centre, during the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections. The Corporal’s widow who was accompanied by family members including her 4-year-old son was presented with a bank cheque by INEC on Thursday, in Abeokuta, the State capital, According to the deceased’s wife, life had been hard on her after the loss of her late husband, stressing that she would do anything to bring him back. While appreciating the INEC’s kind gesture, Blessing, however, admitted that the compensation would not be enough to survive the economic challenges she is faced with.

Life is not easy. Two hands are better than one. Things are too difficult, even day and night, I find it difficult to get a solution on how I will train my child. I don’t know how I will stand, because it is not easy. My son is just 4 years old.” “All I know is that my husband is more than that. If he is alive today, he will do more than that for me and my child.” While presenting the cheque to the late corporal’s family, the State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof Abdulganiyu Raji, said the gesture was in fulfilment of the insurance policy of the electoral body for ad-hoc staff and other security personnel attached to it. Raji, who described the late cop as a patriotic police officer, said the compensation would serve as succour for the deceased’s family. He said:  This is not a replacement of life. Life cannot be replaced, but just as a way to compensate the family. This is just for you, your son and family to start a new life. We believe that this would be a catalyst for your loss.” “Those who are responsible have been apprehended and all the necessaries would be done to ensure that they face the wrath of the law.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
