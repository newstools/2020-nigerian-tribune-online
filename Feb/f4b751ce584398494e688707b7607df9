Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi has said the Dr Kayode Fayemi administration would continue to make use of wise counsel and advice of elders to ensure peace and development of the state. Egbeyemi said the role of elders in ensuring peacebuilding and peaceful coexistence among residents of the state cannot be overemphasized hence their relevance in ensuring stability. The deputy governor who spoke at the January meeting of the Ekiti Council of Elders held in Ado Ekiti, the state capital also appreciated the body’s interest in making the Southwest a peaceful zone in Nigeria. The elders discussed a report on the issue of land usage by non-indigenes in Ekiti handled by a committee raised by them to look into the matter. Egbeyemi, who promised to convey the decisions reached by the council to Governor Kayode Fayemi, said the present administration would not sideline the elders on issues of governance and development of the state. The council resolved that traditional rulers, community leaders and government at all levels to monitor the activities and land usage by non-indigenes across the Southwest. The monitoring, according to them, became necessary to prevent cases of kidnapping, banditry, herdsmen attacks, land grabbing and loss of lives across the towns and villages in the region.
