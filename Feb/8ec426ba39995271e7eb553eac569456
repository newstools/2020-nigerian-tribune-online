NIGERIAN Medical Association (NMA) has expressed concern about the lack of a clear national policy on cancer for the country as well as the low rate of implementation of the Nigerian cancer control plan for 2018 to 2022. NMA president, Dr Francis Faduyile, in a press release to mark the World Cancer Day said that although Nigeria is midway into the time frame for the implementation of this cancer control plan, little progress has been made thus far. According to him, a clear policy on cancer is important to drive the various activities and actions needed to prevent cancer and its attendant morbidities and mortalities in the country. Faduyile said that Nigeria had an estimated 115,950 new cases of cancer and an estimated 70,327 cancer-related deaths in 2018, with breast, cervical and prostate cancers being the commonest.

It is time to end preventable cancer deaths in Nigeria. “We must reverse the trend and contribute positively to influence appropriate responses at individual, family, community and national levels. We must also raise the pillar of support for those in the fight against cancer and their families.” He, however, said that NMA will continue to partner with all relevant stakeholders in the fight against the scourge of cancer and will remain committed to the improvement of the quality of healthcare delivery in the country. Dr Faduyile also empathised with all those in the fight against cancer, their families and loved ones, adding, “we assure you that you are not alone”. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for 9.6 million deaths in 2018, despite the fact that 30 to 50 per cent of these cancers are preventable and another 30 per cent of the deaths avoidable by early detection, diagnosis and treatment.
