She explained that the Mechatronics workshop that is being commissioned will amongst other things serve to upgrade the skills of technicians and craftsmen in the industry by providing modern practical training in general mechanic/mechatronics, welding and fabrication. However, while speaking on the occasion, the Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, commended the Federal Government efforts in this area, adding that his administration will ensure that the people of the state benefit from the training. His words, all those that were trained by the ITF from the statistic record were gainfully employed without any dropout. He assured the Minister that his administration will continue to collaborate the ITF to ensure that the unemployed youths become self-reliant through the mechatronic workshop that was commissioned today. In his remarks, the Director-General of the ITF, Mr Joseph Ari said that “I wish to urge the people of Kano as well as the North West to take advantage of this opportunity provided to acquire skill as it is a vehicle for national development. He said it remains the most viable and sustainable solution to rising unemployment and poverty and the surest way with which Nigerians can be equipped for employability and entrepreneurship. Mr Ari noted that “it is in appreciation of this fact, coupled with soaring unemployment and rising poverty that the current management in the ITF refocused its activities to impact skills to as many Nigerians as possible through the training of over 500, 000 Nigerians through its skills intervention programmes.
