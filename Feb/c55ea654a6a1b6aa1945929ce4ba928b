A group under the All Progressive Congress (APC), which goes by the name “Youth Vanguard for Real Change,” has condemned what it described as the continued assault on Supreme Court justices over the nullification of the election of David Lyon as the governor-election of the state. The condemnation came in the wake of the reported attack on the Abuja residence of the lead Justice of the February 13, 2020 judgement of the apex court, Justice Mary Odili, on Tuesday during which thugs brandished placards calling her unprintable names. Commenting on the matter in Abuja, the group admonished the APC leadership to blame itself for foisting candidates with forged credentials on Bayelsa APC. Its spokesman Comrade Johnson Dume, said rather than attack the justices, the APC leadership under Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, should not grandstand but apologize to the party’s teeming supporters for the monumental embarrassment the nomination caused them.

What is her role in our party screening and primaries? Is she the one who asked us to field a candidate with fake certificates? We should be careful not to worsen an already bad situation. People are beginning to see APC as a party that lacks due process, and of fraudsters.” Dume added: ” It was the same Justice Mary Odili who they now malign that gave judgement on February 13th to affirm the candidacy of Lyon and Degi. The sudden about-turn projects us as sore losers.” The APC youth leader also requested the party faithful to hold responsible, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, for the party’s loss at the court as, according to him, “we have on good authority that Sylva knew about Degi’s forged documents but yet went ahead to field him so that APC might lose.” It would be recalled that the Supreme Court had nullified the election of Lyon and his running mate, Senator Biobarakumo Degi, who was found to have supplied false information in his credentials. The court ordered that the certificate of return issued to Lyon be withdrawn and handed to the candidate of the party with the next highest number lawful votes and spread, leading to the declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Senator Duoye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the new governor.
