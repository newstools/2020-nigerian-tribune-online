The Prosecutor, Insp Isaac Yakub, told the court that the defendants conspired and used fictitious companies, Jokan System Investment Ltd and De Complete Acess Ltd, to defraud Kam Steel Integrated Company Ltd, Jimba Oja, Ilorin.

Yakub said that the defendants’ phone numbers were tracked, adding that this revealed their hideout in Effurrun, Delta, where they were arrested. The prosecutor said the defendants were arraigned on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, cheating and advance fee fraud. He said the alleged offences contravened Sections 97, 322 and 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act Cap A6, Laws of Nigeria, 2006. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendants pending the outcome of investigations, saying the offences were not ordinarily bailable. NAN SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
