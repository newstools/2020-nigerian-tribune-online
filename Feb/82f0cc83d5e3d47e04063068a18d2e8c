Senator representing Benue South senatorial district, Senator Abba Moro, on Monday, said that falsehood and internet manipulation is a looming disaster to nation’s economy. Moro who spoke in Otukpo at a town hall meeting interaction with constituents for better presentation sought the consent of his constituents to hate speech and protection against falsehood and Internet manipulation bills, saying that he was once a victim of Internet fraudsters. According to him, his bank account was hacked and Seven Hundred Thousand Naira was taken away without receiving a bank alert. He said that the contributions of his constituents would form the crux of his presentation when the bills come up for second reading in the Senate. The senator said that the ruling All Progress Congress employed the hate speech and propaganda to dislodge PDP in 2015 and 2019 elections.

This amount was withdrawn in instalments, the first time it was N200,000.00 and the second time N500,000.00, they did it without me receiving bank alert. “I have written more than three letters and reminders to the Inspector General of Police but I am told they are still investigating for more than two(2) years after. “On hate speech, we should be reminded that the All Progressives Congress (APC) employed the hate speech and propaganda to defeat the Peoples Democratic Party in 2015 and 2019 elections and as such, we should know the implication of their propaganda. We must not get carried away by the sentiment of the moment but find a way to stop it. I will not support the hate speech because of some elements,” Moro said. Most speakers at the town hall meeting drummed support for the protection against falsehood and internet manipulation bill while they called for caution on hate speech bill. The state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party and former member of House of Representatives, John Ngbede and Ezekiel Adaji particularly called for the support of hate speech so that PDP can also use it to dislodge APC in the coming general elections.
