An Ado-Ekiti High Court, on Thursday, sentenced a 55-year-old father, Mr Bashiru Adeyanju, to 14 years imprisonment for attempted rape on 17-year-old daughter without an option of fine. The court found the defendants guilty of the offence of attempted rape of his daughter due to his confessional statement and witnesses called during the trial. The presiding judge, Justice Monisola Abodunde, however, did not find him guilty of the offence of serial rape which he was also charged with. Justice Abodunde said after listening to both prosecution and defence counsels, saying that the prosecution had proved his case beyond reasonable doubt and established the case of attempted rape of his daughter.
