Olufemi Lanlehin. The group said that they were direct casualties and sacrificial lambs of the alliance as all their 32 House of Assembly seats went along the coalition. “The body language of the governor is that of abandonment to fulfilling his own part of the agreement despite that we have staked everything possible to his electoral victory at the polls. “That victory was our joint efforts and the terms of the promises should be fulfilled without further delay. “We have sacrificed so much than to be abandoned, used and dumped, ignored or treated in this manner. We should be setting good precedence, as we did in the last election,” the group said. It noted that they did not request and were not given any financial compensation before consenting to the terms of the alliance, adding they were repeatedly assured of consideration for political appointments. According to the group, “these assurances were also re-emphasized with us by the governor during his thank-you visit to Sen. Lanlehin residence.” NAN. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
