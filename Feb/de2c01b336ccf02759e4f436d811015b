Kogi state commissioner of information and communication, Kingsley Fanwo, said Ministries, Departments and Agencies in the state will henceforth print all government documents at the government printing press in Lokoja. The commissioner, who disclosed this while inspecting facilities at the Kogi state printing press, said with the recent circular from the office of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), it is no longer permissible for MDAs in the state to seek government’s approval to do their printing jobs elsewhere. Fanwo, who paid a working visit to the state printing press with top management team of the state information sector, said he expected total compliance to the directive as no other decision surpassed that of the state executive council. The commissioner said, “The executive council have already resolved that MDAs should not print anything outside anymore and the governor has directed full compliance to the EXCO resolution. This is already in force and we will ensure we produce quality prints to justify the confidence reposed in the press by the Government.” While stressing the need for better repositioning of the state press to function optimally, Fanwo said bottlenecks would be removed for enhanced profitability of the investment.

We are not only waiting for government jobs alone but we are prepared to take over the printing industry in the state. “The era of handling government businesses with levity is over. I urge the management to immediately turnaround the fortunes of the press and get multimillion jobs in order to shore up the revenue base of government. Corruption at the press will be met with stiff penalties”, he warned. The government printer, Mr. Teddy Adegbola, who received the visiting team, listed challenges of the press to include inadequate manpower, equipment, office space and operational vehicles. The Commissioner had earlier held a meeting with the management of the State Information Sector on rebranding The Graphic Newspapers. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
