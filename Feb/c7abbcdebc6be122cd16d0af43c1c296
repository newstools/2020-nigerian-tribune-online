The Oyo State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, called on the executive arm of government to put measures in place to checkmate the high prevalence of rape in the state. The Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Adebo Ogundoyin, who made the call at the plenary, said that there was the urgent need to sensitise members of the public, including parents and children, to always speak up in any situation of molestation and rape. “There is the urgent need to educate the people about the dangers and threats of child abuse, both of which are important to the future of the minor. “The citizens need to be sensitised through the media; they need to be carried along on government programmes, particularly those relating to molestation and rape,” said Ogundoyin.
