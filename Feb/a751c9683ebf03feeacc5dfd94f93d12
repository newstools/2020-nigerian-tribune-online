The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, on Wednesday, harped on the need for all the Service Chiefs to think outside the box in a bid to end insecurity in the country. Rep Gbajabiamila gave the charge in Abuja, during a meeting with the Security Chiefs held at the instance of the joint Committees on Army, Navy, Air Force, National Intelligence, Defence. The meeting was in response to public outcry and the recent motion passed by the House seeking the sack of the Service Chiefs over the resurgence of insurgent attacks in the North East region as well as killings of innocent citizens by kidnappers, bandits and herdsmen. Recall that both Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila had on Monday met with President Muhammadu Buhari to vent the frustrations of members of the National Assembly over unabated cases of killings of innocent citizens by Boko Haram, kidnappers and bandits across the country. The Speaker who briefed the Service Chiefs on the resolution and various concerns raised by members during the debate last Thursday stressed the need for the Service Chiefs to justify the confidence reposed in them to occupy such office. According to him, “It was a natural reaction that we reacted the way we did because back home our constituents are on our necks because they are dying every day, they are dying callously in ways that you can just imagine if there’s no security.

I hope to get some commitments from you. “I’m sure moving forward things are going to get better. We know what the basic problems are, there’s the issue of equipment, personnel and other things that would be said off-camera. “We know our Committees are capable to handle these issues. It is the government’s priority and I think it should also be our priority in the House as security is one of those major items on our legislative agenda, and we must address it squarely, totally. “However, whatever needs to be done, we must think outside the box by taking the fight to these criminals. Nigerians, are anxious and the stakes are high, but I do understand the limitations of the outburst “As I said, the Navy or neither the Air Force is not created for an internal strike rather it is the Police that is trained for this but I always say it is because of the circumstances. You have done a good thing by joining to fight for this struggle. But this is squarely the jurisdiction of the Police. I want to encourage you to do more”. As at the time of filing this report, some Senators who earlier met with the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abubakar Adamu joined the joint House Committees on Army, Navy, Air Force, National Intelligence, Defence at the closed-door meeting.
