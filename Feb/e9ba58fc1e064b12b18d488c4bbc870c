The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Tuesday arraigned a staff of a first-generation bank, Babatunde Keshinro, before an Ikeja Special Offences Court for allegedly stealing N12.6 million belonging to a customer. The EFCC charged Keshinro with nine counts bordering on theft, forgery and fraudulent use of the account. The EFCC Counsel, Mrs Bilikisu Buhari, said that the Keshinro committed the offence from 2016 to 2018 in Lagos. Buhari alleged that Keshinro stole funds belonging to one Alhaji Ganiyu Oseni, whose account he managed. “The defendant knowingly forged Baritos Nigeria Ltd’s document titled Part Termination of Fixed Deposit – 1770522625 dated December 12, 2016, and purported to have been signed and issued by Oseni. “Sometime in August 2018, Keshinro forged a cheque number 47423262 dated August 16, 2018, in the sum of N340,000 which was purportedly signed and issued by Oseni. “In May 2017, he forged a cheque with number 35744848 dated May 22, 2017, for the sum of N303,000 also purportedly issued by Oseni. “Another cheque with number 35744834 in the sum of N971,000 also purportedly issued by the complainant,” she said. According to the EFCC prosecutor, the defendant also forged three more cheques which he fraudulently claimed were signed by Oseni.

The offence, she said, contravened the provisions of sections 287, 365, 337 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos 2015. Following the arraignment, the defence counsel, M. S. Ehizoge via a bail application dated February 10, prayed the court to grant Keshinro bail on liberal terms. “The applicant is not a flight risk, he has no prior criminal record. When he was granted administrative bail by the EFCC he always came to their office. “He has been in custody since December 17, 2019, I humbly pray that he be granted bail in the most liberal terms to enable counsel to have proper access to him,” Ehizoge said. Buhari, however, opposed the bail application and asked that the defendant be remanded at the correctional centre due to the overwhelming evidence against him. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo in a short ruling admitted Keshinro to bail in the sum of N5 million with two sureties in like sum. Taiwo adjourned the case until April 8 for trial.
