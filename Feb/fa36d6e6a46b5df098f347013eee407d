A group, the Association of Nigerian Professionals in Europe (ANPE), has warned against any meditated non-diplomatic regional alliance with the Republic of Chad, capable of thwarting progress in the fight against terrorism. The group gave this warning on Tuesday at the end of its plenary after critically examining the country’s efforts in the war against terrorism and insurgency. In a communique signed by its president, Dr. Agwu Onyeke and representatives drawn from 13 other countries, the Nigerian professionals expressed concern over an alleged pact with Chadian soldiers entered into by Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State. This was just as ANPE warned that states and governors in Nigeria should desist from entering alliances that were capable of jeopardizing the ongoing war by the Federal government of Nigeria, saying that such engagement was prone to creating conflicting loyalties on the part of the countries that were being courted by these governors.
