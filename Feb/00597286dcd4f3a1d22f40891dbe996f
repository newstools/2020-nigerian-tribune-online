The Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Crisis Resolution Committee set up by the Osun government, on Sunday evening,  asked Oyo State government to make its decision known on the ownership of the institution. Addressing a press conference, the chairman of the committee, Professor Olu Aina, also called for a roundtable meeting with the Oyo State government to settle, once and for all, the lingering ownership crisis of the jointly owned institution. Aina explained that his committee had forwarded a letter to the Oyo State government, requesting it to make its decision known on either retaining the joint ownership of LAUTECH with Osun or the assets of the institution should be shared. He also disclosed that Osun State government had resolved to retain the joint ownership of the institution with Oyo State and had communicated its decision since January 7, 2020, to Governor Seyi Makinde, saying Oyo government was yet to make known its stand decision on the matter.

Aina, however, maintained regardless of whatever decision Oyo intends to take on the university and its affiliated Colleges and Faculties (College of Health Sciences in Osun and 11 Faculties in Oyo) there is still need to hold to a roundtable discussion with Osun on its final stand. He expressed the readiness of Osun State to align with any decision taken by Oyo government on the issue of LAUTECH ownership, just as he urged the government of Government Seyi Makinde to come to a roundtable for the matter to be discussed and ratified.
