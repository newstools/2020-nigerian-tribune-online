She later became famous for her musical appreciation and a skillful showcase of vocals. While her fan base grew in trickles, she joined a girl band and continued to unravel her creative self, making cover records to popular music classics and writing her own songs. By the time she was 21, Ona Dema decided to take her musical prospect up a notch by launching a professional career. At the dusk of the 2018 year, she dropped her debut single ‘Waka Waka’ produced by Qasebeatz and it garnered a lot of rave reviews. Her graceful reception in the music industry led to the release of more radio-friendly music singles, all of which enjoy adequate rotation on the airwaves. Now that Ona Dema is signed to Sony Music West Africa, she commented on her deal saying, “I’m still pinching myself wondering if this is really happening. This Sony signing is a confirmation that dreams really do come true if you believe and chase it regardless of what anybody says. I know this is a platform that will let me put my best foot forward and shine while at it, and I am very excited about what we have coming.” Ona Dema’s dream is to become one of the top-rated female musicians to be reckoned with. She is however confident on not only blowing her fans’ minds but also tingling their ears in the process of working hard and tirelessly to attain this feat. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
