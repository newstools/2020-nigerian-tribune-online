It has gone beyond using guns and protesting, but by taking our concerns to God. According to Esther 4:14: “For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall the enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this. So, I urge all and sundry to partake in this development as it will yield a lasting result. “I believe in the efficacy of prayer. This is why we declared a seven-day prayer for peace in Nigeria to be observed by all members of CSMC from the first  seven days of the Lenten period, which is to commence on February 26 to March 3, with songs C&S Hymns 729,508 and 476 and also Bible references, Psalm 14, 114 and Revelation 14 respectively. “If we wholeheartedly pray for our country, the result will be as recorded in the book of Daniel 3:28. I am sure God Almighty will save Nigeria and all evil plans and imaginations will not materialise in Jesus name,” he added. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
