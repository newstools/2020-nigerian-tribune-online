The government should continue to focus on stigmatisation and discrimination against people living with the disease. “People are charged fees to get drug and this discourages them from seeking services. There should be a rapid test for suppression. There is a great stride in Benue. People should talk about HIV/AIDS publicly. Target is to have an HIV/AIDS-free generation”, she said. The Director-General, National Agency for Control of Aids, Gambo Aliu who also spoke at the event through his representative, Dr Kayode Ogungbemi said that over 24million people are on the antiretroviral drug in the world, one million of them from Nigeria and one hundred and fifty thousand in Benue. Launching the program, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom appreciated the US government and other agencies for their support to the State, maintaining that their knowledge has been very impactful. Ortom assured that the stigmatisation law domesticated by the State will be enforced. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
