However, he said that with prayers, the problems confronting the nation can be surmounted. Kukah said the essence of the procession is to mourn and pray for those that were massacred by insurgency, banditry and other forms of insecurity in the country. He pointed out that the lent season is a period of soberness and prayer, saying the church would use the period to pray for peace to reign in the country. “As Christians, our God answers prayers because he a living God.” The procession started from Holy Family Cathedral Ahmadu way through Abdullahi Fodio road, Aliyu Jodi way and ended at the Cathedral.
