Giving her evidence Rukayat said: “My lord, my life became miserable the moment I decided to marry my husband. “Taoheed is not only irresponsible but also troublesome. “He was always looking for a reason to fight me. He would raise dust over trivial issues and beat me. “My lord, all Taoheed knew to do was to spend his whole income on alcohol.  He would consume bottles of beer and would not stop until he was drunk.

He didn’t give me a dime for my ante natal care and the purchase of our baby’s needs. “He later left home and kept his whereabouts away from me. “It was my parents who came to my aid by providing all that the baby needed. “My lord, Taoheed eventually returned home but rather than change he got worse. “He took another wife when our child was just two years old and refused to give me feeding allowance. When he did, it wasn’t more than N200. Any time I complained he would beat me mercilessly. “He later took to monitoring my movements and accusing me of dating other men. “My lord, he eventually married three wives and starved me and three children I had for him. “I moved to my parents’ house after he had abandoned us because of his wives but he came there to threaten and fight me, “she stated. Lanrewaju told the court, ”My lord, I’m also no more interested staying married to an arrogant woman like Rukayat. Rukayat is also a pathological liar. “My lord, I pay our children’s school fees as at when due and monitor their welfare.

Our son told me of recent that this man maltreats him. I got furious and went to fight him. “My lord, I also pray that you separate us, “he said.  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
