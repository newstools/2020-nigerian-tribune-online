The Rivers State government has accused the Federal Government of not interested in protecting Former Governor of Rivers State, Dr Peter Odili and his family from sponsored threats to their lives. The State Executive Council made the allegation on Wednesday in view of the recent attacks on the residence of Dr Odili as a result of the Supreme Court judgment that nullified the election of David Lyon as Governor of Bayelsa State. The Rivers State Executive Council observed that the Federal Government seems not to show interest in the sponsored threats to the lives of Dr Peter Odili and members of his family and condemned the barricading of his residence  at Maitama, Abuja by sponsored thugs of the All Progressives  Congress (APC). In a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, the Rivers SEC wondered “why Dr Peter Odili’s family should be singled out for the unwarranted attack, when the judgment that ousted David Lyon as Governor of Bayelsa State was a unanimous decision of a five-member panel of Supreme Court Justices”.

The SEC said further; “The Rivers State Government warns that should this harassment  and intimidation  continue, it will have no alternative than to retaliate. The Rivers State Government will defend the lives and property of Rivers people at all times. Enough is enough”. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
