Such remarkable memories will always remain with us as reference points. “It is very commendable that the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organisation (WHO), designated year 2020 as the Year of the Nurses and the Midwives; which also coincides with the 200th anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth. “This development I believe will fulfill the yearning of millions of members of this profession to have a global platform to reposition the profession for greater heights.” Dabiri acknowledged the contribution of the Nigerian Nurses Charitable Association-United Kingdom and commended them for bringing the training to Nigeria. She called for further collaboration between them and their counterparts in Nigeria, adding that their contribution cannot be over-emphasised. She pointed out that the government cannot do it alone, hence, the need for them to come home, establish health facilities and contribute to the development of nursing profession in the country.
