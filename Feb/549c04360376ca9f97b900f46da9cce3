President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the latest killings of people in Damkar and Tsanwa villages in Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State, perpetrated by bandits, saying that killing in the name of revenge was not acceptable. A statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), said in a reaction to the incident in which many homesteads were razed by fire with many people killed at weekend, the President warned that “no one in the country has a right to take laws into his hands by the way of self-help or revenge. Local communities that catch bandits should hand over the suspects to law enforcement authorities instead of meting out capital punishment, leading to a cycle of revenge and counter revenge.” ALSO READ: Senate’s decision on 2014 Confab, El-Rufai reports laudable ― SMBLF Senate’s decision on 2014 Confab, El-Rufai reports… Stakeholders want Olubadan, Alaafin, others to prevail on… MDCAN threatens strike over PhD demand for clinical… Constitute new panel, review, nullify Imo guber judgement,… He urged community leaders and the local authorities to continue their efforts in partnership with law enforcement agencies that bring the surrender of bandits, leading to peace between farmers and herders. “The authorities must be allowed to investigate and deal with any breach that occurs.
