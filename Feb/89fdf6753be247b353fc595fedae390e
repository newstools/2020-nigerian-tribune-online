THE innumerable incidents of discrimination, denial, persecution and harassment of Muslim women in hijab in public places such as schools, hospitals, ministries, departments and agencies must stop forthwith. This statement was made by the coordinator of Concerned Muslim Women, Oyo State, Hajiya Asia Isah Usman, at an open-air lecture held last weekend at Mapo Hill, Oja’ba, Ibadan, to commemorate this year’s World Hijab Day. While noting that the hijab is a divine identity of the Muslim woman enjoined on her by Allah, Hajiya Isah Usman stated that it was saddening that despite the proclamation of the United Nations General Assembly and the provision of the Nigerian constitution which guarantee freedom of thought, conscience and religion, Muslim women and girls are still being subjected to persecution, ridicule, oppression and injustice because of their religion. According to her, image capturing for essential documents at the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigerian Immigration Service and the National Identity Card at the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) had become burdensome for Muslim women “due to the fact that they are insulted, ridiculed and molested by officials of these organisations to remove their head covers or expose their ears even though their faces and finger prints are visible.” She reiterated the demand of the Concerned Muslim Women that Muslim ladies serving the nation in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and the military and paramilitary agencies be allowed to use hijab. She also called on all “true” human rights advocates to fight for the right of Muslim women to use hijab as recognised by the constitution. In the same vein, Ustadh Ismail Is’aq Animashaun and Ustadh Abdul-Hafeez Abdul-Azeez Ariremako implored women in hijab to observe head covering in its entirety and to strive for excellence in all they do because hijab is neither an hindrance to success nor an obstacle to the attainment of greater heights in life.

The scholars stated that the Qur’an indicate that the use of hijab is a divine injunction which brings about the fear of Allah and decency. While clearing the misconceptions surrounding the use of hijab, the scholars reiterated the need for Muslim women to observe the conditions attached to the use of hijab and eschew all forms of immorality. They emphasised that Muslim women should maintain the standard of Islam in dressing at all times and abstain from using the hijab as a fashion statement. The Chief Imam of Ibadan land, Sheikh Abdul Ganiyy Abubakr Agbotomokekere, who was represented by Alhaji Abd-Fatah Alaga, urged Muslim women to be of exemplary conduct in the society. In attendance at the event were different Muslim organisations and students from schools across Ibadan. This year’s World Hijab Day was commemorated by millions of Muslim women across different states in Nigeria and around the world. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
