The students of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai, have bemoaned the shortage of transportation means to school premises, especially to morning hour lectures and pleaded with the Students’ Union Government as well as the school management to come to their help. According to Umar Yunusa, a student at the university, it was learnt that since the commencement of the semester, students have found it difficult to get to their lecture halls on time due to the shortage of transportation means such as motorcycles, buses and tricycles. One of the students who pleaded anonymity, said that “the cause is unknown to me, but I suggest the school management should provide more means of transportation because they only have few tricycles which only operate between Main Campus to Kobo axis.” She also pleaded with the authorities to review the cost of services rendered by motorcyclists.

Siraj Bala, a 200-level student of Agricultural Science, added, “the bike men should be persuaded to register in order for to reduce the difficulties students undergo.” In his own opinion, a third-year student of Public Administration, Isah Muhammad, said, “this shortage of transportation is as a result of too many of admission slots given to students this academic session.” Suggesting a way out to the matter, he charged the SUG leaders to provide more busses that will transport students to their various destinations. Also, Hamza Ibrahim Abaga, a final year student of Mass Communication, urged the school management to put in modalities such as inviting non-governmental organisations to invest in transport in order to assist the school transportation system.
