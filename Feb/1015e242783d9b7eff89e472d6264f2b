The Trade Union Congress(TUC) in Ekiti chapter, has tasked the new Head of Service, Mrs Peju Babafemi to strive hard and bring innovation and restructuring that will depoliticize the civil service for better productivity. The labour union urged Babafemi to bring professional touches to the service, for it to be able to deliver on its mandate of supporting the political class to transform the state. Babafemi, the first female Head of Service, took over from her predecessor, Mr Deji Ajayi, who retired on Monday, February 10 after clocking the statutory retirement age of 60. In a statement in Ado Ekiti by its State Chairman, Comrade Sola Adigun said, ” Politics has always been the bane of Ekiti civil service and a dividing force, which must be tackled headlong.” Fayemi approves Amotekun bill, to be presented to assembly… Fayemi approves six months maternity leave for workers in… Ekiti SUBEB trains 2,000 teachers, others in 13 months Kwara govt to pay N30,000 minimum wage ALSO READ: Publish names of ghost workers now, Kogi Labour challenges Head of Service Adigun, who also doubles as the Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools (ASUSS) added that” If Mrs Babafemi can succeed in tackling this menace, Ekiti will have the best civil service in the country and it will be to the benefit of all of us. “As professionals, we must not carry the toga of any party.
