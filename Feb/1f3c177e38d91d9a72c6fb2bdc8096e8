MINISTER of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has facilitated the correctional service drug production for inmates on behalf of the government of Nigeria. The Correctional Services drug production through Nipripharm Drugs and Research Centre has the capacity to produce medical supplies and it has the dynamics of positive change for the health of inmates. Aregbesola said humane consideration and compassion must be the watchword of our custodial officials even as they effectively discharge their duties just as the Nigerian Correctional Service has said it has begun the production of drugs to meet the health demands of inmates across the country. It said that the drug company at the Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja, had been  manufacturing Paracetamol and Septrin. Nigerian Correctional Service has over 250 centres across Nigeria with some becoming dilapidated; having been built for over a century. I must commend the Federal Government, under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, for giving some of the centres a facelift. They were neglected for years but upgrading has commenced in some of the formations across Nigeria. The Federal Government is stimulating growth in local pharmaceutical manufacturing with the flag-off and assisting companies that are pioneering efforts in local manufacturing in Nigeria by encouraging purchase of their products and creating enabling environment for their operations. Insecurity: Yoruba group to Buha­ri, call Miyetti Allah to… Hypo launches nationwide campaign against LASSA Fever How we are using software to build low-cost technology… How to clamber out of the pit of stagnation in 2020 The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has commenced the manufacturing of drugs in order to meet the health demands of inmates across the country. Aregbesola said that the drugs distributed would serve all the custodial centres for the year 2020 and attendance to the health challenges of the inmates would be faster through drugs distribution across the formations. The drugs should be used for the purpose for which they were bought and health of the inmates must be prioritised.  Inwalomhe Donald, inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
