To eliminate Lassa Fever in Nigeria, the West African Postgraduate College of Medical Laboratory Science (WAPCMLS), declared that all rats in the country must be wiped out. The scientists said Lassa Fever is easily spread among our populace because the carrier of the diseases is here with us. Addressing a press conference, on the induction/investiture and 2020 annual congress of WAPCMLS, which will take place in between Friday and Sunday this week, the Chairman, Steering Board of the organization, Dr Godswill Okara, said the infectious agents of Lassa Fever is here with us, and the disease can only be eliminated if all the rats in the country are wiped out. He said: “Diseases by their very nature do not know national boundaries, race, colour or social status. We are all witnesses of how one man, the late Amos Sawyer, a Liberian stepped into Nigeria in 2014 with the Ebola Virus disease infection, and the entire Nigerian nation was shaken with a public health emergency of unprecedented dimension.
