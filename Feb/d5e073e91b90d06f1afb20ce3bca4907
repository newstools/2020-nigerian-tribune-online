The Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) has prosecuted 95 culprits for crossing highways following the step-up exercise of LAGESC on its Operation Zero Tolerance to the indiscriminate crossing of highways in Lagos. The Corps Marshal of the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), CP Akinpelu Gbemisola (rtd) stated this yesterday at the Command Headquarters, Bolade-Oshodi. Gbemisola reiterated his commitment to sustain and extend the operations to every part of the State which is in line with the mandate of the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to stem the spate of environmental offences and traffic laws in the State.

She noted that every LAGESC officers on lawful duty are to be officially dressed in the LAGESC uniforms with their name tags boldly on it. The Marshal, however, warned imposters extorting money from the general public in the name of LAGESC to desist from such act as well as rumor peddlers to abstain from misleading the general public with wrong information. Gbemisola, therefore, encouraged pedestrians to make use of the bridges for free flow of traffic stating that it is an offence to endanger their lives by crossing the highways which put them at risk of getting knocked down by ‘hit and run’ drivers. While affirming the stance of the Lagos State Government to protecting unnecessary loss of lives and to ease free flow of traffic, the Corps Marshal reaffirmed the commitment of the Agency at ensuring arrests and prosecution of defaulters who fail to make use of pedestrian bridges where they are erected strategically for crossing of highways.
