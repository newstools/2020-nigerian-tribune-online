The organised labour in Bayelsa State has mounted pressure on the new governor in the state, Senator Douye Diri, to offset the outstanding January salary of some workers in the state civil service. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) made the demand in a separate interview with journalists on Tuesday in Yenagoa. The unions explained that some workers in local governments, teachers in primary and secondary schools, workers in the Rural Development Areas (RDAs), ministries, higher institutions, government parastatals among others are owed January salary. The organised labour, however, congratulated the governor, Sen. Douye Diri, and his deputy, Sen. Lawrence Ewhrudjakp, and promised readiness to support government policies and programmes aiming at moving Bayelsa forward.
