Ekiti State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda has assured the people of the State that they will strengthen its advocacy and fight against the increasing rate of sexual violence in the state. The Attorney General made this assertion on Friday while receiving the wife of the Governor and the Ekiti State Gender-Based Violence committee members at the Ministry of Justice complex in Ado-Ekiti. The wife of the governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi on the purpose of her visit to the ministry said the ministry of Justice needs to gazette the amended Gender-Based Violence law to enable wider access especially within the magistrate and High Courts.

In his response, the Attorney General, Olawale Fapohunda appreciated the support of the wife of the governor in ensuring that the menace of sexual violence is eradicated in the state. He, however, reinstated the approval of the state governor, Kayode Fayemi that the Gender-Based Violence Law and some other laws of Ekiti State be translated into the Yoruba language, to ensure that everyone understands the contents of the laws. While speaking on the issue of incessant rape by teachers of secondary schools, the Attorney General said all secondary school principals needed to caution their teachers to avoid being “vicariously liable for the omission and acts committed by these teachers”.
