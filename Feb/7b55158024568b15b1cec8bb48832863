The Taraba Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources on Thursday organised a meeting between crop farmers and herders to engender peaceful co-existence in the state. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. David Kassa in Jalingo said that the workshop was necessary to breed mutual coexistence among the two indispensable actors in agricultural production. Kassa said that the peaceful coexistence among the two would create an enabling environment for accelerated food production in the state in particular and the nation at large. He said that the state had invested many funds into food production, noting that peace was paramount in achieving the goal of food security in the state. “Taraba as one of the major key players in food production in the country found it quite expedient to enlighten crop farmers and herders on mutual coexistence.
