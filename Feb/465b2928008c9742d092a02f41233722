The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Senator Adeolu Akande as chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). Mr Uche Onwude was equally confirmed as a member of the Board of the telecommunications regulatory body. Before the confirmation, senator representing Lagos West, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, however, called the attention of the lawmakers to the circumstances surrounding the removal of the erstwhile chairman of the NCC, Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye, by President Muhammadu Buhari which he viewed as unceremonious. He appealed for the intervention of the Senate on the matter, so as to give the former lawmaker and former chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission the opportunity and privilege of tendering his resignation. He was however countered by President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan. The President of the Senate said the intervention to allow Senator Durojaiye to have proper resignation was beyond the jurisdiction of the Red Chamber. He said: “The Senate did not initiate the nomination. The Senate received the nomination from Mr President. The initial nomination of the former chairman was only brought to the Senate to be confirmed at that time.

However, I really sympathise with the situation, but I want to remind you, that the prerogative of nominations rests with Mr President.

The confirmation of the nominees was sequel to the consideration of the report of the Senate Committee on Establishment and Public Service, presented by its chairman, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau.
