Three weeks after it directed its members to stay away from work, the leadership of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees(NULGE) in Oyo State, on Tuesday instructed members to resume work on Wednesday. In a memo titled “resumption of duty” dated Tuesday, 18 February 2020, signed by the state secretary, Chucks M. Nwankwo and sent to its members across the 33 local government and 35 Local Government Development Authorities, through the union’s state officers and all branch chairmen of the union, reads: “our press release of 25th January 2020 and our letter vide NULGE/OYS.4/Vol.VII/56 of 4th February 2020 on the above subject matter is pertinent. “The SEC-in-Session on Tuesday, once again appreciate the co-operation and solidarity of our members with the ‘Sit at home’ directive issued in the wake of the leadership feud in our respective Local Governments and having reviewed the prevalent situation resolved as follows: “That our members resume work immediately, i.e with effect from Wednesday, 19 February 2020.” The union thereafter saluted its members’ courage while the struggle lasted.

He said members have been directed to resume back to work on Wednesday morning. He said on Tuesday “since it is past 4.00 pm already. We’ll resume back to work on Wednesday morning.” It would be recalled that the union directed its members to stay away from work on January 27 in view of the friction between the sacked members of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria ( ALGON) and the newly constituted local government caretaker committee members in the state. The NULGE chairman stated that the executive directed its members to stay away from work pending when the ongoing feud between the two warring parties would be resolved, adding that the decision taken by the highest policy making body of the union was binding on all council workers, and the resumption date would be determined later.
