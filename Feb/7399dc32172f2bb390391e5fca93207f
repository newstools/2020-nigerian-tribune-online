The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, at the weekend commissioned three roads and erosion control projects in Oyo State, executed under the Ecological Fund. The speaker, who was accompanied by two senators from the state and some members of the House of Representatives from within and outside the state, also paid a visit to the paramount ruler in the state, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Saturday by the Special Adviser to the Speaker on Media and Public Affairs, Mr Lanre Lasisi. According to the statement, while receiving the speaker in his palace, the Alaafin thanked Gbajabiamila, the National Assembly and the Federal Government for ensuring the projects were accommodated in the budget and completed. He also charged the lawmakers to do everything necessary to keep Nigeria one.
