A former Senate spokesman, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, has justified his decision to seek the review of the judgement of the Appeal Court that sacked him and installed Senator Biodun Olujimi as the senator representing Ekiti South Senatorial district. The Appeal Court, in its judgement of November 2019, validated the outcome of the Justice Danladi Adeck-led Election Petition Tribunal, which ousted Adeyeye and declared Senator Biodun Olujimi of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the actual winner of the election. Worried by the judgement, Adeyeye sent a petition to the Appeal Court President, Justice Binta Bulkachuwa, seeking review of the judgement, he described as error-ridden, in the mathematical computation of the results. Speaking while appearing on a programme tagged: ‘Journalists Hangouts’, on Television Continental (TVC) and monitored by Tribune Online, Adeyeye delved extensively on the review being sought, which bordered on the reversal of the appeal court judgement, describing the verdict as a travesty and abrasion of the rule of law. He said: “When you find out that an election is fraught with irregularities and of course my election is never fraught with irregularities, the remedy that is available is already in section 140 sub-section 2 of the electoral act. They went against that, which is that you don’t declare any winner and awarded victory to her.

If they declare another election now, I will win with a larger margin, that is the truth.

They know who they voted for, go there and do any research. I am fighting now not for myself but for the people. “The election is clean and I have told you the mathematical impossibilities that are contained in that judgement like adding 37 and one to be 71 instead of 38. “They should have asked at least another election but they know if they hold this election many times, I will always win,” Adeyeye stated. But Senator Olujimi countered the position maintained by Adeyeye that she got undeserved and perverted justice. According to Olujimi, “Does he want the tribunal to be reconstituted for him? After all, he had a representation of eminently qualified lawyers at both the tribunal and the Court of Appeal. Despite that, he got 3-0. “All the judges at the tribunal agreed that I won the election. At the appellate court, I also scored 3-0. If he was sleeping at the Tribunal, was he also sleeping at the appeal? Is he asking them to reconstitute a statute-barred tribunal for him or what is he saying? “Has he gone to court or is just writing a frivolous petition? Is he saying that six judges don’t know what they were doing? “I have tried not to speak about it because I know he is hurt and injured, but when you are running after a thing and you don’t get it, you take a rest. He is not the only one that lost an election at the tribunal,” she said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
