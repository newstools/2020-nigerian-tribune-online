The Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions has intervened in the raging cold war over market share between two players in the Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) industry, the Seven-Up Bottling Company and an indigenous company, Rite Foods makers of Bigi Cola. Findings revealed that Rites Foods which came to the CSD industry in 2016 with a breakthrough has been having a running battle with Seven UP Bottling Company and another multinational company.
