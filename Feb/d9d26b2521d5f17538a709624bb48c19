The growth in the Provost’s K-9 capability is equally projected to create the capacity for the Air Provost to be integrated into the conduct of Combat Search and Rescue operations in the Service”, he added. He added that “Indeed, the long-term outlook, is to have Military working dogs’ operations fully encapsulated in the law enforcement, base defence and special operations of the Nigerian Air Force, as well as in Military Aid to Civil Authority when the need arises,”. The CAS, however, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his leadership and determination in providing the enabling environment for the Nigerian Air Force to keep discharging its statutory responsibilities despite other contending imperatives.
