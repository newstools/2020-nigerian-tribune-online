Senator representing Bayelsa East and deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last November governorship election in Bayelsa State, Senator Degi-Eremienyo, has given a seven-day ultimatum to a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Miebi Bribena. Degi gave the ultimatum over a statement attributed to the latter on a TV programme, where Bribena was reported to have alleged that Senator Degi in 1990 faced court litigation on grounds of falsification and forgery of a certificate. But Senator Degi in a statement signed by his media aide, Ebinimi Omubo, said the PDP chieftain lied against him.

The statement further recalled that ”Senator Degi has never faced any criminal charge in his career; both in public or private life. ”Bribena by this statement should be ready for the worst legal battle of his life as this will model his mind to speak only the truth but not lying for political patronage.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
