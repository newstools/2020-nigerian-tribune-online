The  Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahya Bello has said that the state decided to borrow an extra 100 million dollars in order to fast track the social-economic development of the state. The governor who spoke through the Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Economic Planning, Asiwaju Idris stated this on Wednesday in Lokoja while briefing newsmen after the Executive meeting of the state government. According to him, there was no cause for alarm over the intended debt as the state is buoyant enough to sustain its present and expected debts. Governor Bello said the state has already paid a visit to the Senate to defend its need for the 100 million dollars which when released will be channelled towards developing the Staple Crop Processing Zone, SCPZ in Alape, Kabba Bulnu area of the state. “The 100 million dollars when accessed will be used to build roads, improve electricity and other social amenities within the Alape Crop Processing Zone.

The fiscal sustainability of the state gives rooms for borrowing. If the state debt has not gone beyond 250 per cent of his income then, it can still borrow. Kogi is presently at 147 per cent.

Kogi is presently using only 28 per cent of its IGR to service loans. We still have a difference of 12 per cent to borrow. “We are not borrowing for consumption. We are borrowing to build capital projects. This is in line with the state government’s fight against insecurity. Because if you don’t provide food security then any fight against insecurity will be a mirage.” The Finance Commissioner also said the state government at the Executive meeting approved the creation of a new Department of International Cooperation to coordinate funds from World Bank and other donor agencies. He said all ministries has also be mandated to look inward and contribute to the economic development of the state in line with the fiscal discipline directive of the governor’s agenda. Also speaking, the state Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo said the state government has directed the security apparatus to put in measures that will ensure the security of life and properties. He said the governor’s directive is on the sideline of the recent crisis in Aku village of Ankpa local government that led to the death of three and burning of many houses over chieftaincy tussles. “The state has put in a rapt security strategy which may not be revealed now but is in place to stop any form of crises. “The state has also set up an empowerment program for youths and women to address poverty in the state.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
