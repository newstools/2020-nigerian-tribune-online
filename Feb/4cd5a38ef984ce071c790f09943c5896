Hypo, makers of Nigeria’s famous bleach product, has formally launched a nationwide Sanitization campaign in open markets to curb the prevalence of Lassa fever, especially in areas mostly affected by the plague in  Nigeria. The Sanitization Campaign, which is  in collaboration with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), will see the Hypo Team visit major open markets across 11 states in the country, with the aim of  enlightening market women and the entire public on the Lassa fever epidemic and steps to keep their environment clean. Nigeria has registered an upsurge in the number of Lassa Fever cases since the beginning of the year, with 365 positive cases and 47 deaths reported from 23 states across the country.

Addressing the gathering at the market, the Public Relations Manager, Tolaram Group, Omotayo Abiodun stated that the campaign, which kicked off simultaneously in two locations, Oke Arin Market and Oja Oba Market, in Akure South Local Government, Ondo State,  would tour other markets at Ekpoma Main Market,  Benin and Wuse Main Market in Abuja.
