The Ondo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) said, on Monday, that about N13 billion had been committed to basic education by the state government in the last three years. The SUBEB Chairman, Mrs Oladuuni Odu, stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting in Akure. “As at date, a sum of N13.2 billion has been expended by the Gov Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led administration on basic schools in the state. “There are constructions of new classrooms and perimeter fencing as well as the renovation of the existing ones. “There has been the provision of playground and information technology equipment as well as erection of containerised toilets and supply of pupils and teachers’ furniture to the newly-constructed schools,” she said. Odu added that the government had also provided borehole and water sanitation, and early childhood care development equipment for public primary schools in the state. According to her, the government has introduced some games such as volleyball, badminton and table tennis to develop the interest of the young ones in sports. “All the equipment for these games have been provided for some selected schools in the state. Agriculture has also been introduced into some of our schools,” she said.
