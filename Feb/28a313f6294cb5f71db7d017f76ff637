Nigerians have reacted to the peaceful protest staged by Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), otherwise tagged a “Prayer Walk” led by the general overseer of the church, Pastor E.A Adeboye, over the state of insecurity in Nigeria. Recall that Tribune Online had earlier reported that Adeboye led the members of the church on a prayer walk in accordance with the directive of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). This has generated a lot of reactions among a cross-section of Nigerians. Senator Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker commended Adeboye for disembarking from the fence of caution, moderation and neutrality and leading a match against insecurity.
