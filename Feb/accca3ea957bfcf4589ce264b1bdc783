No fewer than 750 indigent students are to benefit from the Aisha Buhari Foundation’s Future Assured Youth Educational and Empowerment Programme (FA-YEEP) in Adamawa. The First Lady, Aisha Buhari, stated this at the inauguration of the programme on Friday in Yola. Buhari, represented by Prof. Abubakar Tahir, the Lead Consultant of the programme in the state, said the gesture was to complement government effort at all levels. She said the gesture was to address the problem of out-of-school children, particularly the girl-child. “The case of `out-of-school children is most disheartening in the northern states where insurgency, poverty and socio-cultural norms have played key roles. “This is further worsening what is left of the ruins of dilapidated structures, insufficient and poorly motivated teachers at all educational levels,’’ she said. The First Lady said that the programme would deploy e-learning techniques to train the students who had once attempted but failed to pass school examination certificate to enable them cope with current realities.
