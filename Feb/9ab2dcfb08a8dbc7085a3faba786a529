A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former acting chairman of the party, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, has called for dialogue among various groups, individuals, government and security agencies to solve security challenges the nation is currently going through. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin at the weekend, on the sideline of his 69th birthday, Alhaji Baraje lamented the unabated security problems and mass killings of innocent citizens, saying that it was becoming too worrisome, alarming and getting out of control of the nation’s security outfits. The PDP chieftain, who said that the greatest problem the country is facing is insecurity, urged Nigerians particularly the youths to be security conscious about their environment and report strange people as well as suspicious objects around them to the appropriate authorities. “I wish to appreciate all Nigerians for their resilience, perseverance and “Never Say Die attitude” at this very difficult times in Nigeria. Everybody is aware and are now feeling the punches of the difficult times, good governance is really difficult to get these days. I, therefore, wish to say that the most difficult and most depressing of the entire situation is the insecurity in the country.

He charged the legislature whom he described as the eye, the brain and the conscience of the people to insist on good governance while the judiciary should also deliver justice to the masses and called for decentralization of the authorities and the institutions. Speaking on the 2023 general elections in the country, the PDP chieftain said the party is intact and preparing for the elections and urged their leaders and supporters to remain focused and more united, more so, that the electorate has now realized the difference between the present APC administration and that of the PDP.
