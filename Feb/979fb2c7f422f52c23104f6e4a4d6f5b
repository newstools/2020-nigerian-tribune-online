Oyo State Commissioner of Health, Dr Bashir Bello, on Friday, revealed that investigation into the suspected case of Coronavirus in the state showed that the patient neither contacted Corona nor Lassa virus. Answering journalists’ questions on the state’s preparedness for Coronavirus, at State Secretariat, Ibadan, Bello said the suspected case was earlier quarantined and his health was improving. While recognizing the proximity of Lagos, which recorded its first confirmed case, to Ibadan, the state capital, Bello said that the state had deployed adequate resources to its facilities in case of unforeseen circumstances. Though he noted that the state had no outbreak of Coronavirus presently, Bello pointed out that a quarantine facility had been set up at the Army Barrack Odogbo, Ojoo, Ibadan. Noting that all state health facilities had been put on high alert, he enjoined private based health facilities to also have a high index of suspicion for all cases of unexplainable fever and upper respiratory infections.

He also urged residents to reduce the frequency of face touching, regularly disinfect surfaces and keep social distance with anyone sneezing or coughing. “What we saw at Oyo was nothing close to Lassa or Coronavirus. We are ready as we don’t know who would have travelled in and out of Ibadan. “For the least symptoms of respiratory distress, we give them that maximum attention and we treat it like a case. A single case is considered an epidemic. That was why with the single case in Lagos, all other neighbouring states are on high alert. “What we are trying to do is that going by our proximity to Lagos and the high level of the transaction between these two urban centres, we are very prepared because no one can tell. “There is freedom of movement enshrined in the constitution and we cannot, for this reason, restrict the movement of individuals. I wish to reassure the people of the state that there is currently no outbreak of Coronavirus in the state,” Bello said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
