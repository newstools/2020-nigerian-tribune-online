On the first anniversary of his near-fatal helicopter crash in Kabba, Kogi State, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has attributed his miraculous survival along with 11 others in the aircraft, to the mercy of God. Speaking after a thanksgiving service at the Aso Villa Chapel in Abuja on Sunday, he described the survival as a “miraculous and divine deliverance,” noting that the incident has strengthened his faith in God. According to a statement issued by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo stated that the incident also strengthened his faith in Nigeria, as well as the faith of everyone who survived the chopper crash. The statement quoted him as saying: “I think that what happened on that occasion was so amazing and miraculous, 12 of us in a helicopter; the helicopter crashed and not one scratch on any one of us. That’s just incredible. So, we can only continue to thank God and praise the Lord Jesus Christ for the awesome deliverance of so many of us. That’s why we are here this morning just to praise God.
