TOWARDS a paradigm shift in the provision of quality health in Fiditi, an agrarian community, its indigenes, under the aegis of Fiditi Strategic Development Initiatives, have made a donation of hospital equipment, borehole and other ancillary equipment for the smooth running of the hospital. Chairman, Board of Trustees, Fiditi Strategic Development Initiatives, Mr Tunde Ogunmola, making the presentation to Oyo State Commissioner for Health, Dr Basir Bello, said the group had prioritised health because health is wealth. Mr Ogunmola said the painting of the hospital, as well as the donation of hospital equipment, were in support of government to stem Nigeria’s high maternal mortality rate and ensure a more conducive environment for the care of patients. He said the group was aware that the government could not do everything in health because of the paucity of funds, hence  the donation of the equipment and industrial borehole for the smooth running of the hospital. According to Mr Ogunmola, “This is not the only thing we have lined up to do, but we are only starting with health. Our plan is to make the Fiditi General Hospital a reference point in this environment.” Chief Executive Officer, Fiditi Strategic Development Initiatives, Mr Ayobami Olubiyi, declared: “I am sure that in the next few years, this hospital will not remain the same.” According to him, the Fiditi Strategic Development Initiatives plans to be having medical doctors in the diaspora hold 10 to 12 days medical outreach yearly to support the provision of quality healthcare in the community.

Oyo State Commissioner for Health, Dr Bashir Bello, speaking through Director, Secondary Health Care, Dr Wale Falana, who appreciated the gesture of the group, said health “is cardinal in Oyo State government’s agenda” and assured of boosting the staff strength of the hospital in the ongoing recruitment exercise by the government.  Dr Bello said Oyo State after re-equipment of Ring Road State Hospital, had promised to do the same for all general hospitals throughout the state. He said the state’s participation in many Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) initiatives and the state’s health insurance has further improved health care services in government hospitals. Dr Bello, however, urged members of the Fiditi Strategic Development Initiatives to support the enrollment of people in the community under the state’s health insurance scheme to further better their access to healthcare services. Earlier, Fiditi general Hospital’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tolani Kasika said the hospital attends daily to between 20 and 40 patients every day, including infections such as malaria, treatment of snake bites and accidents, noncommunicable disease as diabetes and hypertension. Items donated include three delivery couch (imported); three examination couch (imported) for the accident and emergency, six sphygmomanometers (blood pressure measuring machines), laptop and printer, split unit air conditioner and a double door refrigerator.
