The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has blamed President Muhammadu Buhari for what it observed as the excruciating ordeal Lagosians are facing following the ban on the use of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in the state. While sympathizing with Nigerians living and working in Lagos, the main opposition party said there would have been no such ordeal if Buhari had in 1985, not terminated the initial Lagos Metro Rail Line project started by the government of Alhaji Lateef Jakande to facilitate mass transportation within Lagos, as Nigeria’s commercial nerve centre, and surrounding cities. In a statement issued in Abuja by Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary, the PDP stated that but for Buhari’s action on the laudable project by the Lagos State government, Lagosians would not be suffering the transportation infrastructure deficit they are faced with today.

The statement added: “By now, Lagos State would have been boasting of state-of-the-art transportation infrastructure and facilities with an associated economic boom like her peers in other parts of the world.

Such an attitude to governance is the marked difference between our party and the anti-people APC.” The PDP, therefore, counselled the government of Lagos State to immediately adopt alternatives to ease the suffering of the people as their welfare ought to be its primary focus of governance.
