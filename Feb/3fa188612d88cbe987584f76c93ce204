The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, to immediately prosecute the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, for incitement. In a statement issued in Abuja on Friday by Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary, the party observed that the violence and arson perpetrated by APC agents in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state capital, on Friday, was in furtherance of Oshiomhole’s inciting call that no governor would be sworn-in in Bayelsa State, contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court. The statement said: “Oshiomole’s statement was a direct call for sedition and violent subversion of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the statutory authority of the Supreme Court and the mandate of the people of Bayelsa state.
