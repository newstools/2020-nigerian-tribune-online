THE chairman of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Alhaji Zikrullah Hassan, has signed the 2020 hajj agreement with the Establishment of Pilgrims of African Non-Arab Countries in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The signing of the agreement is a condition for all hajj-participating countries. The agreement borders on services available for pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah. Hassan also signed agreement with HAFIL Transport Company for the movement of pilgrims from place to place during hajj. The company is operating under car syndicate services to transport pilgrims within Saudi Arabia during the hajj exercise. In December, Nigeria signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Hajj on the participation of the country in the 2020 hajj exercise. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, signed the document on behalf of Nigeria, while Dr Saleh Bn Taher Benten, signed for the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Hajj and Umrah. Following the MoU, Nigeria got an allocation of 95,000 slots for this year’s pilgrimage.
