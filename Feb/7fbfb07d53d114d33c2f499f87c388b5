It’s amazing how technology has made life easier and convenient. I am writing this article from Newark Liberty International airport in New Jersey, United States of America waiting for my flight to the United Kingdom. I arrived the airport a couple of hours ago and checkin for my flight was automated. Instead of having airline officials checking you in it was a checkin machine that was doing the job and a single staff just stood by in case people had issues with the machines. The need for humans was totally cut off. All you need do was to punch in the necessary data as prompted by the machine and all things being equal you get your boarding pass printed and you just needed to drop your luggage to be transported to the plane. I had a little issue with excess luggage and since there was no cash transaction allowed all I had to do was get to another machine which converted my cash to a card which I then used to pay my excess luggage at the check in  machine. I remember arriving earlier at heathrow airport. I got to the passport control and all I did was scan my passport and pronto a gate opened and I was let in without any human interaction. I am sure if there was any problem them ,there would have been the need for a human being to do some interrogations. There is always two sides to any coin so there has been the argument about the pros and cons of the use of  machines. If our lives will count we must have a balanced approach to the use of machines and technology. Some believe technology is gradually taking the place of human beings. They argue it is making human beings redundant thereby increasing unemployment. “On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages, for example, dependence on new technology. Man no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory. The decline of human capital implies an increase in unemployment. In some areas, devices can replace the human mind.” Nick Ismail Raufu Olaniyan: A true Omoluabi @ 60 The Ekiti State six-month  maternity leave Ayade and the dreams of our founding fathers Tech-U VC warns students against cultism, exam malpractice Some people are outrightly against technology even though technology is a reality we have to accept, embrace and maximize if we are to function effectively in life. “Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.”   J.K. Rowling Many have argued that technology and machines is creating a breed of people who are unduly dependent on them at the expense of their mental faculties. shut their minds and unduly relied on technology. People have become last mentally. “I  like my new telephone, my computer works just fine, my calculator is perfect, but Lord, I miss my mind” Author Unknown “Once upon a time we were just plain people. But that was before we began having relationships with mechanical systems.  FOR ENQUIRIES/ COMMENTS PLEASE SEND EMAIL TO charismokola@yahoo.com to be continued next week SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
