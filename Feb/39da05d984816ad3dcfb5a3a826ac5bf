Ehanire gave this assurance on Sunday, while briefing newsmen after inspecting facilities at the Emergency Response Readiness designated for the Coronavirus victims at the Mainland Hospital, Yaba in Lagos. “I can say that Lagos State is well prepared; there is a high level of readiness here, and also the awareness is there,” he said. Enahire, therefore, commended the state government for its level of preparedness against the outbreak of any infectious disease in the state. While expressing satisfaction at the infrastructure put in place, he said that the state, considering its vulnerability to infectious disease, had learnt lessons from the Ebola episode of 2014, and reflected the experience in its level of preparedness. “It is quite clear that Lagos has a clear-cut edge in managing infectious diseases and preparedness.

Abayomi noted that novel Coronavirus was not a racial illness, adding that the disease can affect anybody while warning that perpetrators of fake news would be punished when caught.
