THE Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), on Thursday, announced that it had recovered a sum of  N77.04 billion assets from operations, interim and final forfeiture in 2019, while about 1, 934 petitions were also received within the year under review. Director, Public Enlightenment and Spokesperson for the commission, Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa, who announced this during the Presentation of 2019 Performance of the ICPC to newsmen at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja, however, said only 580 petitions were concluded investigations. She explained that some of the petitions did not belong to the commission, hence, the need to pass it on to the relevant agencies. She further said some of them were even repetitions as four to five persons wrote the same petition, making the figure keep rising. While giving the break down of the assets recovered, Mrs Okoduwa said about N1.16 billion (cash) was already at TSA, while N32.038 billion was estimate of assets recovered on lands, building and vehicles; N41.98 billion was restrained on review of Ministry, Department and Agency (MDA) personnel cost expenditure; as well as N0.767 billion recovered from projects tracking and N1.097 billion completed projects on return of contractors to site.

If you ask us now that where are those assets? We can show you, we have the register of those assets. Those that are not cash. The fixed assets, immovable assets, it is actually what we can prompt to, it is not just figure.” ICPC spokesperson said it is obvious that the commission has become better and made progress and its focus now is to build on that so as to take the staff to a greater height and greater level.
