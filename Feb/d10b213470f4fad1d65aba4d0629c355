In the days of our parents and grandparents, it was common practice for couples to go through some form of matchmaking. Two fathers and in some cases, mothers too, decide to bring their families together as a great idea to unite and further consolidate the bond between both families. The children get married and the rest is history. In our contemporary era, there are hookups and introductions that take place daily. Friends introduce each other to their other friends; family members introduce members of their families that are single to other eligible bachelors and spinsters. Some of these relationships sometimes end up as happily ever after; which is oftentimes the main goal.
