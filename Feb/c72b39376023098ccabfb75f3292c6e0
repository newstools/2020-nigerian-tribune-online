The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to go beyond his sympathy visit to Borno State and take decisive steps to end the killings in that state and other parts of the country. In a statement it issued in Abuja after the president’s sympathy visit to Maiduguri in the aftermath of Sunday’s Boko Haram in Auno near the state capital, the party said the booing of the President during the visit was a clear message to him that Nigerians hold him responsible for the escalated insecurity in the country. Signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary, the statement added: “It (booing) also shows a loss of confidence in the Buhari Presidency and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).” The PDP demanded that they should not limit his visit to Borno State but also visit other parts of the country, including Kaduna, Kano, Benue, Plateau, Yobe, Adamawa, Zamfara, Kogi, Niger, Taraba and other states to face the feelings of Nigerians as well as view the national devastation his poor handling of security and infrastructure has caused our nation. The party hoped that the visit to Borno State, which the party claimed came only after it and Nigerians criticised the president for his aloofness, particularly over the Auno killing on Sunday, “is not part of the usual presidential media stunts that will not be followed with a corresponding action to track down killers and end terrorism.” Buhari not listening to anyone ― PDP PDP rejects move to get $500m loan for NTA High turnover rate of legislators has hindered vibrant… Baraje calls for dialogue to solve Nigeria’s security… ALSO READ: UPDATE: Nigeria gets three centres to test for coronavirus The PDP further charged Buhari to endeavour to go on subsequent visits by road in order to see and feel the agony Nigerians were being subjected to with the parlous state of the nation’s road infrastructure and security network under “the incompetent and unresponsive Buhari Presidency and APC.” The PDP posited: “Nigerians do not deserve a distant President, who sits in the comfort of the Presidential villa and luxury jets, remaining indifferent to the pains, anguish and torments that compatriots suffer on daily basis.” The PDP, therefore, called President Buhari to quickly embark on these visits and monitor, on first-hand basis, “the damage which his administration has caused and for which Nigerians are demanding that he resigns and allow more competent hands to manage the affairs of our nation.” “It is only after these visits that the Buhari Presidency will appreciate that those calling on him to rejig the nation’s security architecture mean well for our dear country,” the PDP declared.
