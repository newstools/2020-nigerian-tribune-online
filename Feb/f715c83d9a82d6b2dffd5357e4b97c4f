Dr Afeez Enifeni, a former President, Association of Resident Doctors, Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Lagos, has identified brain drain as a major hindrance to the development of the nation’s health sector. Enifeni spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos. According to him, the factors contributing to brain drain must be addressed, in proffering solutions to the challenge. He said the Federal Government should create an enabling environment for health professionals to address the problem of brain drain and labour mobility in the country. Enifeni called for well-equipped hospitals, as most of the existing hospitals lacked the basic facilities for effective operation. He said that a well-equipped and funded training should be designed and made available to the health practitioners for continually advancing the skills and knowledge of the profession. “It is not money alone that makes people travel out of the country to practice; sometimes, they do not have the freedom to practice effectively.

There are chances that they can search for a better working environment elsewhere to operate. “Availability of well-defined career pathways and endpoints, as opposed to what is present with improved welfare package like indemnity, insurance, health insurance and opportunities for advancement, are some of the motivational packages to retain health professionals,” he said. Enifeni said that without specialisation, patients would not get the quality services they required for improved healthcare delivery. “We need more specialised professionals in the health sector, as this will not only improve the quality of healthcare services but also improve the lives of the patients. “There is also a major challenge where there are specialised people but are not employed. “Specialisation is keyed in healthcare service delivery; let health practitioners be trained to be specialists in various categories of health management.” According to him, the country’s health system is weak and, therefore, needs to be strengthened. Enifeni also called for increment in the national budgetary allocation to the health sector and proper auditing of finances and programmes within the sector for improved performance.
