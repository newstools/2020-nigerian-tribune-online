The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Wednesday pledged to commit up to $100 million for the global response to the novel coronavirus epidemic that has claimed nearly 500 lives. The funding will be used to strengthen detection, isolation and treatment efforts, the foundation said, including protecting at-risk populations and developing vaccines and diagnostics. Gates Foundation CEO, Mark Suzman, said: “Multilateral organizations, national governments, the private sector and philanthropies must work together to slow the pace of the outbreak, help countries protect their most vulnerable citizens and accelerate the development of the tools to bring this epidemic under control.” Coronavirus: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gives $10m… ALSO READ: IGP lays insecurity challenge on governors The foundation said it would direct $20 million to organisations like the World Health Organisation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection, the National Health Commission of China and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
