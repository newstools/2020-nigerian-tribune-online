The Zone RS2 Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), comprising Ogun and Lagos States, says it has prosecuted 158 traffic offenders from January 1 to February 17. The Zonal Commanding Officer, Mr Samuel Obayemi, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Monday. Obayemi said that 155 of the prosecuted offenders were convicted of various traffic offences, while the remaining three were discharged. Obayemi, an Assistant Corps Marshal, said that the prosecution was part of the measures to increase the efficacy of FRSC’s enforcement operations across the zone.

According to him, one of the strategic goals of the corps for 2020 is to reduce Road Traffic Crashes and fatalities on the highways by 15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. He said that the goal was also to promote safety consciousness among road transport operators.

He urged Lagos motorists to exercise restraints and patience due to the ongoing constructions on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Lagos-Badagry Expressway, Gbagada-Apapa Expressway, Sagamu-IjebuOde Expressway and other areas. “If they obey law enforcement agencies managing the traffic flow, desist from driving against traffic at the slightest delay and obey traffic regulations strictly along these corridors, the gridlocks will reduce and the traffic will flow better. “Tow-trucks and tow-vans are parked at strategic spots along these corridors to clear obstructions as they occur,” Obayemi said. He said that FRSC was committed to keeping highways safe and would continue to carry out its duties diligently. NAN SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
