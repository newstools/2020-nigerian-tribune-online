A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abdulmumin Jibrin on Thursday vowed not to quit politics despite his defeat in the recent election re-run in Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State where he represented in the House since 2011 to 2019 before his sacked by the Court of Appeal. Hon. Jibrin disclosed this to newsmen at the Lobby of the National Assembly when he came to return belongings of the Assembly in his possession since he lost out in the re-run in the Federal Constituency he earlier represented. The lawmaker who declared emphatically that he was still in politics, said: “I’m an advocate of everybody being involved in politics. So politics does not necessarily mean you own an office. You can be a journalist supporting democracy. You can be someone who takes his vote very seriously and exercise it. You can be an advocate.” Speaking on his next political move, the former lawmaker said he leave that to Almighty God, adding, “the future looks very bright. And one has had a very interesting career in the House in the last 10 years.

Jibrin said being in public service is about sacrifice. According to him: “I am not looking out for compensation but again I am not tired to serve the country in any capacity either in my private capacity or again to call upon to provide services to the government.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
