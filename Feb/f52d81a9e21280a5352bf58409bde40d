The minimum wage is to be applicable to all ministries, departments and agencies of government, local governments, parastatals and primary school teachers in the state. Speaking on the agreement reached, Adeosun said, “We just reached a landmark point in the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde today. “In the past few weeks, you are aware that we have been negotiating based on the agreement reached at the federal level on the minimum wage and consequential adjustments for the workers in Oyo State. “We have just signed our agreement and the highlight of the agreement signed is that the least paid worker in Oyo state will earn over N30,000 monthly in agreement with the minimum wage signed at the federal level. “We have also agreed with our colleagues that the consequential adjustment required as a result of that minimum wage reached has also been agreed and reached. It has been a long process. We have had to look deeply into the books and all the factors required to ensure that even as we signed this agreement today, we get to an agreement that is sustainable, agreeable and affordable for the government and people of Oyo State. We have made an informed decision.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
