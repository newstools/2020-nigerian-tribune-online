The Ondo State Police Command has arrested two suspected ritualists in the state, Idris Sule and Alfa Alhassan, after discovering a human skull and two roasted hands in their possession. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Mr Femi Joseph, who disclosed the arrest of the two suspects explained that Sule, a 50-year-old farmer and the native doctor was arrested in Ido-Ani in Ose Local Government Area of the state with the human parts. According to him, Sule confessed to the crime which led to the arrest of Alhassan, an Islamic cleric, who was said to have ordered Sule to bring the human parts. Joseph said “this morning a 50-year-old suspected ritualist was caught with a human skull and two arms badly roasted along Ido -Ani area of the state. “The suspect confessed to the crime and led to the arrest of Alhassan but an investigation has commenced into the matter and details will be made known to the public soonest,” The PPRO however, debunked the story that the arrested suspects are a pastor saying the suspects were arrested in Ido -Ani and not Alagbaka area in Akure as being speculated by some people. He described a story being circulated on social media as untrue saying no man of God was caught and arrested with 17 fingers human skull and some other parts.
