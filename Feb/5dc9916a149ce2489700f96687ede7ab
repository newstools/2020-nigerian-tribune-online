China’s Foreign Ministry has blasted the US government for restricting the entry of Chinese nationals due to the coronavirus outbreak, which this week was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation. On Saturday, Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said although the WHO has only just specifically advised against any travel restrictions, the US has decided to act in the opposite way. “This has set a bad example. It is certainly not a gesture of goodwill,’’ Hua said. New US measures include a ban on the entry of foreign nationals, other than the immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days. The US also took the “unprecedented” step of placing 195 US citizens who recently returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan in quarantine for 14 days. Schools, factories and offices across China are due to remain closed even as the week-long Lunar New Year holiday comes to an end. Apple on Saturday became the latest company to announce the closure of its stores in mainland China to prevent the spread of the virus, with the measure set to remain on place until Feb. 9. According to the most recent figures from Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in China has risen to over 11,000, while a total of 259 people have died. Officials in Hubei province in central China, the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, said an additional 1,347 new cases had been reported in that province alone, bringing the number of infections there to 7,153. Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, and many other Chinese cities have been placed on lockdown. The number of people infected and China’s national death toll are expected to climb further once other regions report their latest statistics. Over 100 other people have become ill in about 24 countries across the globe. Sri Lanka became the latest country to report a case when a Chinese woman travelling there was found to have coronavirus.
