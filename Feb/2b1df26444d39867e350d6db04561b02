The companies exempted include; Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria, Chi Limited, TG Arla Dairy Products Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc (MSK only) and Integrated Dairies Limited.

He commended the exempted companies for their resilience, doggedness, commitment to local milk production and bold steps at backward integration. The Director-General, however, urged the government to ensure policy consistency and also encourage investment in animal husbandry. According to him, it will enable the organisations and many other players in the industry to focus on their core business of dairy and milk production. He said that the experience in other climes showed that animal husbandry was a thriving industry that generated large employment for citizens and revenue for the government. “Government should institutionalise dialogue and focus engagement with organised businesses before taking fundamental policy decisions that can affect businesses. “A collaborative approach to policy formulation and implementation will do well for the development of the nation,” Olawale said.
