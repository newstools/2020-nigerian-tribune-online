Against the backdrop of an alleged attack on him by the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, on Friday, the Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhirulai Akinropo, on Saturday threatened to soon drag Oluwo to court over the alleged assault. It is recalled that Oba Akanbi allegedly attacked his counterpart, Oba Akinropo during a peace meeting over land tussle, which was held inside the office of the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police, Zone 11, Mr Bashir Makama. However, Oba Akinropo, who spoke to Sunday Tribune through his lawyer, Mr Babajide Siyanbola, said the physical assault he suffered in the hands of Oluwo would not just be treated with kids gloves. According to him, “we would as a matter of fact institute legal action against Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi over this matter very soon. We will definitely take action by seeking redress in the court of law.” A descent into bestiality Fans come for Burna Boy after declaring self best artiste… Hopefully, someday, Supreme Court will remove president Who are the terrorists?

Speaking on behalf of the monarchs from the district, the Olu of Ile Ogbo, Oba Habeed Adetoyese said “we implore the government to immediately suspend him (Oluwo) so that we can have peace in our domain. We have called our subjects that there is no cause for violence, but he should be checked. Only the governor can caution him and if that is not done, he would destroy the entire region. “The state governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, should take action on Oluwo matter. This is because he was threatening us (Obas) on Friday at the AIG’s office. We don’t want a situation whereby hoodlums would be chasing us with guns in our palaces.” Others monarchs from Osun West Senatorial District include Onigege of Igege, Oba Kazeem Oyediran; Onifin of Ikonifin, Oba Solomon Ojo; Oluwo Oke of Iwo Oke, Oba Kadiri Adeoye and Onisara of Eesu, Oba Moshood Oparonla.
