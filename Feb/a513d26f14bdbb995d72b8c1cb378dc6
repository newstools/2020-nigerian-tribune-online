It is said that privatisation of the power sector had rather than becoming a blessing had turned out to be a curse. We all know how much we pay as bills on a monthly basis. The bill is always on the high side” Continuing, he said “There is need for regional integration on the transportation sector across the Southwest. Building the rail transportation system will enhance trade across the region and with a stable rail transport system, the region will definitely become the business hub for foreign investors.” He, however, lauded the Southwest governments for making Operation Amotekun work, warning however that the initiative would require a modern strategy to combat varying challenges. Adams added that “the best way to address the challenges of our time, in all areas is to be committed to the Yoruba cause.” In his own remark, the Alake and Paramount ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo said the Operation Amotekun would foster peace and security in the Southwest region.
