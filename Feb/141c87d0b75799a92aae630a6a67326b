The House of Representatives and the Armed Forces on Wednesday reiterated commitment toward tackling the activities of insurgents being aided by foreign governments. Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Jimi Benson gave the assurance while speaking with newsmen in Abuja after the closed doors meeting held with the Service Chiefs and the Inspection General of Police, IGP, on the spate of insecurity ravaging the country. He also confirmed that the lawmakers discussed issues bothering on sponsorship of insurgents by foreign governments who are allegedly arming insurgents. According to him, “Like I said that was part of what we discussed you understand, there could be some truth in that.

Benson said: It’s not a U-turn but the most important thing that Nigerians want is, one – security of their lives and their properties to be protected. That is the meeting we are having today. “Sacking Service Chiefs, we can suggest but it is the function of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces the buck stops at his table,” he affirmed.
