Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo  and the Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwoolu, have commended  Airtel Nigeria for coming up with the Airtel Touching Lives  initiative,  aimed at putting smiles on Nigerians’ faces. Speaking at the official launch of  the 5th edition of the Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of the company,  in Lagos, recently, the Vice President  described  the initiative,  as an evidence that the company actually cares about its immediate operating environments. The nation’s number two man argued  that it was  becoming increasingly  obvious that despite the activities and policies of government, aimed at ameliorating the plights of Nigerians, no government would be able to do it alone. “We need the support of individuals and corporate organisations to help us achieve our dream of ameliorating the sufferings of Nigerians. That is why we are delighted at this CSR initiative of Airtel, meant to bring smiles to the faces of Nigerians and complement the federal government’s efforts at doing same,” he stated.

He also expressed the belief that the initiative would go a long way in giving support to the state government in its bid to provide  succor to the people of the state. “That is why we see Airtel as not  only a fantastic socially responsible corporate organisation, but a company that we truly need  to partner with,” he added. Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Airtel Nigeria, Mr. Segun Ogunsanya, stated that it was borne out of the need to help the underprivileged in the society. The Airtel Nigeria boss also  expressed delight that the company had been able to help the causes of the underprivileged in the society, in the past five  years,  through the initiative, even at trying economic times, when recession was biting hardest.
