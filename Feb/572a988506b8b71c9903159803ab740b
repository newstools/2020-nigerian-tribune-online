Chief of Army Staff (COAS)  Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, on Friday ordered his convoy to evacuate some passengers whose vehicle broke down along Maiduguri-Damboa road in Borno State. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Buratai who was en route at the time, ensured that all passengers in the vehicle were evacuated into one of the vehicles in his convoy. The action was borne out of the fact that the road was recently reopened by Nigerian Army after over a year of closure. The passenger vehicles were usually escorted in convoy by team of security agencies to and from Maiduguri to their destinations. The driver of the vehicle, Emmanuel John, told newsmen that he was part of the passenger vehicles’ convoy from Maiduguri on Friday morning before he lost its shaft along the road. John said he and his passengers were in confusion and fear before the arrival of Buratai’s convoy, adding that the gesture was a prayer answered for them.
