The Federal Government has inaugurated an 11-man committee to revisit the Public Service Rule 100222, which provides for one-year sabbatical leave for officers on salary Grade Levels 15 and above in the Public Service, predominantly observed in tertiary institutions. The committee was also mandated to develop operational guidelines for contract appointments in the Civil/Public Service of Nigeria. Acting Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan inaugurated the committee on Tuesday in Abuja in line with the ongoing reforms in the public service in the country. She said that the committee was constituted to develop modalities for the implementation of short-term engagements in service, which cover contract appointments, sabbatical leave, exchange programmes and talent sourcing in the Civil/Public Service. She noted that currently, the provision of Public Service Rule 100222 for one-year sabbatical leave for officers on Grade Level 15 and above, has been observed to be predominantly implemented in tertiary institutions and some research institutions. Yemi-Esan said further that there was the need to streamline the provisions of contract appointments in the Civil/Public Service in line with Public Service Rule 020401.

She listed terms of reference of the committee to include examining and making recommendations on the circumstances that might require contract appointment, career exchange and talent sourcing. The committee was also to recommend on the tenure of such contract appointments, qualification and requirements and developing guidelines for determining the commensurate remunerations for officers engaged under the provisions. The Acting Head of Service gave the committee four weeks to complete the assignment while urging them to be committed in the interest of the service. Members of the committee were drawn from different ministries and retired permanent secretaries with the Permanent Secretary, Service Policies and Strategies Office, Dr Magdalene Ajani, as the chairman.
