The financial garbage heaps Nigerian leaders are leaving behind for future generations is reflected in the escalating national debt due to our political leaders’ lack of financial education. The staggering statistics on the nation’s debt have made headlines in recent times. Some questions beg for answers: Has political leaders been budgeting wisely?

Check the priorities of most of our political leaders. What do you find? Only budgets for renovation of government houses, National Assembly etc. Could lack of financial education be one of the reasons our leaders fail at their assignment as public office holders leaving millions of unemployed roaming the streets?
