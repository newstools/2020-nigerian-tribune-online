It is spread through contact with infected rodents or their droppings or through close contact with a person who is sick with Lassa Fever. It usually causes mild symptoms including slight fever, weakness and headache which can lead in some cases to more severe symptoms, shock and even death. To avoid getting infected with the disease, you must avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and faeces and take precautions to keep your accommodation clean and free of rodents.  In addition, the practice of wrapping food items such as ‘akara’ and ‘suya’ in old newspapers should be avoided as these newspapers could have been polluted with rat urine or faeces. You should also wash your hands often and avoid contact with people who are sick and don’t patronise unhygienic restaurants. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
