The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has disclosed that 95 cases of Lassa fever were discovered in the country within one week. As a result, the centre said it would continue to work closely with states affected by the outbreak, while ensuring that the 95 confirmed cases in some states across the country were effectively managed. This is just as another case of the disease was confirmed in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. It was the second in the state so far. Director-General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Saturday, that the 95 established cases were the highest number of confirmed cases in a single week. “This reporting week, NCDC managed a record number of 95 cases. This was possible through collaborative efforts across states with coordination from us,” he said. Ihekweazu added that as of January 26, a total of 258 confirmed cases and 41 deaths were reported from 19 states since the beginning of the year. According to him, of the confirmed new cases, 89 are from Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi states with 38 per cent each from Edo and Ondo, while Ebonyi has 11 per cent. He said NCDC had continued to support states in responding to the outbreak including the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to support affected states. “The NCDC, through its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Gaduwa, collaborates with 37 laboratories divided into five laboratory networks for the diagnosis of epidemic-prone diseases across Nigeria.

Three of these laboratories are situated in states where we recorded the highest number of cases, Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi. “Despite the increase in the number of cases, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) for 2020 is lower at 15.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2019 which was 19.7 per cent,” he stated. The NCDC boss attributed the seasonal rise in Lassa fever cases to ecological factors and the presence of rats in the environment which could transmit the virus. According to him, this is also the case for other African countries with similar context. Confirming the new case recorded in Kaduna at the weekend, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Baloni, added that it was a 34-year-old patient from Kajuru Local Government Area of the state. “In view of the recent Lassa fever outbreak in Kaduna State, the Ministry of Health wishes to update the general public on the situation so far. Kaduna State has recorded a total of 23 cases. Fifteen test results have come back negative, but one new case has been confirmed. However, six test samples are also pending. “The new confirmed case is a 34-year-old male from Kajuru Local Government Area and he is being managed at the IDCC. This brings the number of confirmed cases to two in Kaduna State. The first victim died last Sunday and has since been buried. “Similarly, a total of 40 people who had been in contact with the cases are being monitored and none has shown any symptoms. However, contact listing, follow-up and active case search are ongoing. “The general public is advised to continue to maintain a high level of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation and ensure that all cases of fever are tested for malaria before treatment,” she said. Also, the statement noted that “following the Federal Government’s recent declaration of Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern, Kaduna State government is complying with the advisory on the Corona Virus Disease issued by the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire.
