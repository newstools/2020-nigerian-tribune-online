Aliyu said that the defendants, armed with a locally made single barrel pistol, kidnapped one Abdulaziz Usman while he was coming back from work. “They allegedly pushed their victim into their Volkswagen Golf car and took him to their hideout before they were arrested. “The offences contravened the provisions of Sections 59 and 247 of the Kaduna State Penal Code,” the prosecutor said.
