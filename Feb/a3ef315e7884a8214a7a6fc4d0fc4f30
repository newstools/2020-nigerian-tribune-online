He alleged that the trial magistrate erred in law when she refused to consider the evidence of the appellant. The Solicitor General of Ekiti State, Mr Lade Ojo, who appeared for the case submitted that there is merit in the appeal filed by the appellant’s counsel, Adedeji who said that the judgment of the lower court was wrong and should not stand. He added that he had nothing to argue in support of the judgment of the lower court. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
