A prosecution witness and community head of Makoko waterfront, Mr Steven Aji, on Tuesday, narrated to an Igbosere High Court, Lagos, how a police officer shot and killed one of his chiefs. Aji said this while giving evidence in the ongoing trial of a dismissed police officer, Cpl. Pepple Boma, charged with manslaughter. The community head, who was led in evidence by the Lagos State Prosecuting Counsel, Mr Hafeez Owokoniran, told the court that the defendant shot and killed one Timothy Hunpoyanwa during the destruction of Makoko waterfront settlement. He said that the state government had given the residents notice to evacuate the settlement 24 hours before the incident occurred. Aji said that he and his chiefs were already making arrangements to meet government agents to ask for more time to enable them to get another area to settle. He told the court that they had been living in the Makoko settlement for a very long time, adding that 24 hours was not enough for them to pack out of the area. He narrated to Justice Module Nicole-Clay that immediately after the notice to vacate the area was given to them, government officials and police started destroying their houses.
