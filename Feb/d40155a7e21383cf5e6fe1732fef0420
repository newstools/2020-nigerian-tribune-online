Amotekun is a concept for Nigeria’s national rebirth; it is a baby of circumstance. But frankly speaking we don’t need a leader that will provide circumstances that will put us on edge; too many people have been killed. I advise that the rich philosophy and dimension of opinion behind Amotekun be strongly sustained and pursued to a logical conclusion. Amotekun is needed for peace to reign and for a prosperous modern Western Nigeria and to set the pace for a total natural rebirth. It stands to question the present federal setting as it affects national progress; the world is interested and watching.
