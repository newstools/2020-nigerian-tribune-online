Emmanuel Adebayor has signed for Olimpia as the Paraguayan side announced the former Arsenal striker’s arrival on Tuesday. Olimpia currently sits fifth in the early stages of their Apertura campaign, and President Marco Trovato promised to make a big splash by signing the veteran striker if the club signed up an additional 20,000 members over the weekend. Adebayor was without a club, with the 35-year-old recently becoming a free agent having ended a brief spell with Turkish side Kayserispor in December.

The move does include one familiar face, though, as it does reunite Adebayor with former Manchester City team-mate Roque Santa Cruz, who joined the club in 2016 and has helped lead Olimpia to titles in the 2018 Apertura, 2018 Clausura and 2019 Apertura. Both Adebayor and Santa Cruz joined Manchester City in 2009, but neither forward was able to truly make their mark with the club. Adebayor’s most prominent days came with Arsenal, with the forward playing over 100 Premier League matches for the club. His time with Manchester City included loans to Real Madrid and Tottenham before heading to Spurs permanently. Later in his career, Adebayor has represented Crystal Palace, Istanbul BB and Kayserispor, with the forward scoring two goals in eight appearances during his brief stay with the latter.
