Kaduna State Muslims Pilgrims Welfare Board has said it would soon embark on public enlightenment exercise with the view of educating intending Hajj pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year. This was even as it called on Islamic preachers to re-dedicate themselves towards educating the intending pilgrims. The acting Director Operations of the Board, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan, made the call during an interactive session with Islamic preachers at Rigachikun, Kaduna on Sunday. He said the preachers contributed immensely toward educating pilgrims at home and during the hajj exercise with or without allowances.
