Towards the end of the year 2016, it was obvious that there was the need for enhanced awareness campaign, advocacy and sensitization programmes to educate the law enforcement agencies, civil society organizations and the general public to evolve right attitudinal and institutional changes necessary for successful implementation of an anti-torture law in Nigeria Federation. It is in view of this that Access to Justice and Rule of Law and Anti-corruption, RoLAC, organized a two-day workshop in Awka, the Anambra State, on Thursday with support from the European Union, funded by the British Council, for Civil Society Organizations on the Anti-torture Act 2017. Speaking on the workshop, a Professor of Law at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, also a life member of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, Prof. Ogugua Ikpeze, said that effective collaboration and coordination between government agencies and institutions, as well as educative campaigns and mass awareness, would be of great advantage to curbing torture in Nigeria society.
