Sokoto State government has disclosed its plans to access a loan worth of N65.7 billion naira in its continuous effort to seek better ways of improving the lot of the people of the state. The said loan to be sourced from internal financial sources is meant to fast track agricultural development, housing, health, water resources, judiciary as well as service delivery. The loan is billed to be serviced in 36 months and “would, therefore, not be a liability to be inherited by the successor of this administration,” noted Alhaji Isah Bajini Galadanchi, the state Commissioner for Information. This was the outcome of the state executive council meeting held at Government House, Sokoto, which was chaired by Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal Friday afternoon. Briefing journalists after the meeting along with some commissioners, the Secretary to the State Government, Mallam Umar Saidu, confirmed that the government is desirous of procuring the debt facilities even if it means sourcing for such from abroad.
