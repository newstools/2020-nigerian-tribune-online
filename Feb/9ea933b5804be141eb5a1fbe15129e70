African leaders on Sunday condemned US President Donald Trump’s Mideast peace plan as illegitimate, taking advantage of an African Union summit to voice solidarity with “the Palestinian cause.” AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat told assembled heads of state that the plan unveiled in late January represented the “umpteenth violation of multiple United Nations and African Union resolutions.” He said that it was prepared without international consultation and that it “trampled on the rights of the Palestinian people,” a line that drew applause in the main hall at AU headquarters. Trump’s long-delayed peace proposal was immediately rejected by the Palestinians, who have largely boycotted his administration since it recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017. The proposals include giving Israel the green light to annex settlements in the West Bank, the largest part of the territories the Palestinians see as their future state.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who regularly attends AU summits, did not travel to Ethiopia this year. Palestinian officials said last week that Abbas was heading to the UN to push for a Security Council resolution condemning Trump’s peace proposal. The resolution will almost certainly be vetoed by the US. Abbas was represented Sunday by PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who reiterated Palestinian leaders’ position that the Trump plan “has no legitimacy whatsoever.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
