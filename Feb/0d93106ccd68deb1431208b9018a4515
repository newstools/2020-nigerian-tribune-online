Pandemonium broke out on Thursday at Olomore market of Abeokuta when two Hausa traders were allegedly shot by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This development led to violent protest as the angry Hausa traders blocked the Lagos -Abeokuta expressway, grounding vehicular movement for hours. It was gathered that the SARS operatives stormed the market at about 10.00 am in an unmarked Toyota Sienna, at the time the traders were offloading their goods. The operatives, according to an eyewitness account, Abiola Sani, one Musa Adamu and another, simply identified as, Awwal, were shot by the operatives when they were counting money meant for the payment of their goods.

The victims were rushed to a nearby private hospital, Bisted Hospital but were later referred to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) for treatment. The Chairman of the Pepper and Tomatoes Sellers Association, Alhaji Ishaku Nuya, demanded justice for his colleagues, saying the perpetrators of the act must be fished out and face the full wrath of the law. It took the joint efforts of men of the State Police Command and officers of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) over one hour before the protesters were pacified.
