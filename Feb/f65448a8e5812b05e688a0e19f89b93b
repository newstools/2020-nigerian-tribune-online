The Federal Government on Saturday said it has concluded plans to distribute over 10, 000 tractors and inputs to farmers in the 774 Local Government Areas. The Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, made the disclosure when he paid a courtesy visit to the Emir of Dutse in Jigawa, Muhammadu Sunusi. Nanono disclosed that tractors, fertilisers, chemicals and other inputs would be distributed to farmers under a soft loan scheme designed to encourage agricultural mechanisation. He explained that each of the councils would be allocated N150 million worth of tractors and inputs as soft loan to be repaid in 11 years. “In his new year message, President Muhammad Buhari promised to encourage mechanised agriculture in the 774 local government areas in the country. “What we need is that the beneficiaries must be genuine farmers and native of the participating local councils,” Nanono said. He noted that the gesture was to assist farmers to boost their production capacity so that government could mop up excess produce for the strategic reserve. According to him, the Federal Government would commence implementation of the programme in the second quarter of the year 2020.
