SKYSIGNS, Nigeria’s premier aerial advertising firm, established in the aviation sector to introduce aerial advertising banner towing and pipeline surveillance to the sector, has been granted operational licence by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to commence aerial advertising business in the country’s aviation sector. Aerial advertising is a form of advertising that incorporates the use of logos that fly, manned aircraft, or drones to create, transport, or display, advertising media. The media can be static, such as a banner, logo, lighted sign or sponsorship branding. It can also be dynamic, such as animated lighted signage, skywriting or audio. One of the advantages of banner towing is that for the three hours that your banner will be flown around Lagos for instance is that nearly 20 million people will see. This is unlike static advertisements which you only get to see only if you go to the area the billboard is erected, according to the Managing Director, SkySigns, Mr Bosun Onalaja. While disclosing that he has invested a substantial amount in the firm’s fleet of aircraft which also include the logistics and intense level of training, declared “Our highly trained pilots will fly banners for marriage proposals, birthdays, anniversaries, new birth celebrations, graduations, corporate advertising, branding opportunities and any other special occasion you can dream of no matter how big or small the event will be.

SkySigns and Adverts Nigeria Limited, a pioneer company incorporated on January 25, 2015 under Nigerian law, is presently the only source in West Africa for banner advertising. Narrating how three and half years ago, he realised the huge vacuum in aerial advertising when people were more concerned with digital advertising, Onalaja added: “Because it flies low, many people get to see it wherever they may be, people in Lagos will see your advert. It is very common in South Africa. We also have application for mapping. People have come to make enquiries for their birthdays. We are fully authorized by NCAA, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). “We are partnering with a company in Germany for new technology on banner towing. We had enquiries from Mali. We had enquiries on Sunday for sight-seeing, area mapping and all the rest.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
