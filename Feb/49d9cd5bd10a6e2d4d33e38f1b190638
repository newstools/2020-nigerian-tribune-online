The Ogun State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Engr Bayo Dayo, has accused the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, of fuelling the lingering crisis in the state chapter of the party. He said this while addressing newsmen on Thursday, in Abeokuta, that the unity meeting held at the National Secretariat of the party in Abuja, on Wednesday, was a “mere fluke.” Dayo, who is loyal to Senator Buruji Kashamu, said the crisis is not over yet, wondered why the party chairman would recognise Sodipo when the National Working Committee (NWC) never recognised the Bayo Dayo-led executive. He faulted Secondus for saying that the NWC of the party has the power to conduct congresses in the states and that Ogun State congresses will hold in 2021. Dayo argued that Secondus’s position was against the judgement of the Supreme Court with Suit Number SC.968/2018 which validated his executive council and empowers it to conduct primaries.

Our former secretary who was present there has been suspended before now, but we have been tackling that in-house. “The National secretariat doesn’t go through letters. For all the letters that have been given to them, they don’t go through them. But they knew that we have suspended our secretary, Semiu Sodipo. “It is just a bread and butter politics that they have been playing that is what has been going on, otherwise, they said they don’t recognise Engr Adebayo Dayo led executive but they recognise the Sikirulahi Ogundele’s exco and a man now came to them as the secretary of Engr Adebayo Dayo executive and they are now telling everybody that, he is the state secretary, what rationale is behind that? “They are aware of what is happening and if care is not taken, they will be taken to court for contempt of court at the end of the day,” Dayo added.
