Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what things add value to their lives. The key idea is that minimalism isn’t really about less, it’s about more. Choosing to own fewer things is simply a means of clarifying and focusing on values that can fulfil things that truly matter to our lives. It is in this context that one could situate the LG brand, which brings to mind strong association of the company’s tagline, “Life’s Good”. LG’s forward-thinking, AI-powered Proactive Customer Care for its leading appliances alerts users to energy usage and water consumption and provides thoughtful advice for improving efficiency and saving money is one of innovations that will redefine its lifestyle this decade. According to Mr Hari Elluru, Head of Corporate Marketing, LG Electronics, West Africa Operations, “having less things in a smaller environment can be surprisingly calming, more so when matched with a minimalist lifestyle. This lifestyle can be quite liberating as well but shouldn’t be confused with simplistic living. Doing more with less is about maximising the at-home experience. Instead of seeing this as a threat, LG views this trend as an opportunity.” Elluru stated that the just-concluded 2020 Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas, United States, where LG unveiled its framework for the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development.
