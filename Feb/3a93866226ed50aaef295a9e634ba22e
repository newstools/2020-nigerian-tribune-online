The lingering local government crisis in Oyo State took another violent dimension on Monday, as a clash between supporters of the sacked Chairmen and Caretaker Chairmen in Surulere Local Government, Ireseadu, resulted in the death of one Isah Azeez, while several got injured. Azeez, 50 years was said to have been shot dead as supporters of the sacked Chairman made moves to wrest leadership of the local government from the Caretaker Chairman who had arrived Monday morning to resume office. In the gun exchange, Azeez, popularly known as Alajase, was shot dead, while one Dotun Somefun and several others around the Surulere local government sustained injuries while trying to escape from the attack. The clash was said to have emanated from the Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who occupied the local government secretariats last week, attempting to continue in office, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairmen had resumed office on Monday morning. Prior to the Surulere clash, political thugs had also vandalized vehicles and motorcycles in adjoining local governments of Ogbomoso North and Ogbomoso South local government areas and Ogbomoso Central LCDA.
