A 50-year-old man, Kayode Oladehinde, a resident of Olope Street Ogijo, has been arrested by men of Ogun State police command on 5th of February 2020, for defiling his 13-yr-old stepdaughter (name withheld). The suspect was arrested following a report from the mother of the victim who complained at Ogijo divisional headquarter after her daughter informed her on the 4th February 2020 that the suspect who is her present husband sometimes recently forcefully had carnal knowledge of her as a result of which got her pregnant. She stated further that the suspect having realised that the victim is pregnant, gave her drug to abort the pregnancy resulting in her bleeding seriously.

On interrogation, the suspect who was dumbfounded when confronted by his wife pleaded for forgiveness from his wife and the victim who was his stepdaughter. The investigation, however, revealed that the mother of the victim got married to the suspect after the death of her first husband who was the father of the victim some years ago and had a child for him. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police Kenneth Ebrimson has ordered the transfer of the suspect to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and possible prosecution.
