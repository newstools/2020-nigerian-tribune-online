It added that “Although it is only the payment for the month of December 2019 that is still pending due to the shortfall in revenue allocation for the month from the Federation Account. However, it should also be noted that the government is up to date in the monthly mandatory payment of the N100 million for the Local Government retirees”. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
