It is evident that we have not taken sexual and reproductive health right as a critical aspect of our life. “There are a lot of discussion about women body integrity whether they have a choice to decide the number of children that they are supposed to have and whether the government is contributing enough funds to give the necessary information for people to know how to plan their family in a manner that the country will not have a population it cannot deal with. The government need to see it from the point of view that addressing the problem of population is addressing the issue of sexual and reproductive health right. “We want to build voices around the issues of reducing to a level of zero sexual and gender-based violence, address any form of harmful traditional practices to everybody and to ensure that the issue of sexual and reproductive health right to address the issue of population.” WARDC is a non-governmental, not-for-profit human rights organisation that is committed to the promotion and protection of women’s rights through advocacy, research, documentation and litigation,” she said.
