Nigeria’s Father of Tourism, Chief Mike Amachree, has called on the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, support women in the tourism industry in their quest to grow the sector for the nation’s benefit. Amachree made the call when he paid a condolence visit to the founder of the Webisco International Federation of Women Entrepreneurs and Tourism of Nigeria (WIFWETN), Chief (Mrs) Margaret Bolanle Fabiyi, recently who lost her husband, Chief Ebenezer Fabiyi recently The tourism mogul described the late Chief Fabiyi as an astute businessman with great passion for tourism.  “Chief Fabiyi had so much passion for tourism. That was why he gave his wife the opportunity to be involved in tourism. As you are aware, we can’t talk about female tourism practitioners in Nigeria without mentioning WEBISCO. That is why I call her ‘Mama Tourism.’ Court remands 4 oil & gas directors over  alleged £2.6bn… Coronavirus, Lassa fever: FG offers N36m to scientists for… UPDATE : Ekiti Assembly passes Amotekun bill into law BREAKING: Strange ‘fetish-like’ object causes… “This was only possible because of the support she got from her husband. He gave her moral and financial support that was why it was easy for her to traverse the length and breadth of the country to promote domestic tourism. We thank God for the huge legacy of Chief Fabiyi.” He used the visit to reiterate the need for government to empower female tourism practitioners like Madam Webisco.  He said industry practitioners like Webisco have contributed so much to the development of tourism in the country, but are being hampered by funds. He called on government to intervene and provide them with the needed funds to continue to develop the industry. In her response, Mrs Fabiyi thanked Amachree for the visit. She said the visit was a morale booster for her and also thanked him for playing his role as Nigeria’s Father of Tourism well by visiting and encouraging industry practitioners facing challenges.
