A House of Representatives member, Akin Alabi, said he has began legislative process to repeal a law making the wearing of military camouflage by Nigerians illegal. Alabi, said, “the law is archaic, adding that Nigeria is among few countries where it is illegal to wear the military camouflage, mentioning Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua, amongst others. Akin Alabi flags off 250M empowerment scheme Akin Alabi: Exemplary innovative Nigerian youth As one of the reasons he embarked on  this mission, Alabi said a lot of young Nigerians have sent him messages lamenting the rate at which they get beaten for wearing military uniforms, as according to him, soldiers are seeking such opportunities to ride on Nigerians.   Alabi further expressed his views in a series of tweets posted vis his Tweeter handle:  WEARING CAMOUFLAGE IN NIGERIA Nigeria is one of the countries where it is illegal to wear a military camouflage.

While I don’t agree it makes sense, it is clearly stated in our laws that it is illegal to wear a camouflage or any clothings worn by the military.  Section 110(1), Criminal Code states that it is illegal for non military person to wear the uniform of the armed forces, or any part of the uniform of such forces, or any dress having the appearance or bearing any of the regimental or other distinctive marks of such uniforms. 107  Section 110(1), Criminal Code states that it is illegal for non military person to wear the uniform of the armed forces, or any part of the uniform of such forces, or any dress having the appearance or bearing any of the regimental or other distinctive marks of such uniforms.  There are two exceptions. You can wear it if you have the approval from a governor of the president. The other option is if you wear it during an entertainment performance, like in a Nollywood movie or a music video. The penalty for this is 1 month imprisonment or a fine of N10. 118  There are two exceptions. You can wear it if you have the approval from a governor of the president.

So the law is clear. Do not wear a camouflage. But does the law make sense? I’m sure some people will argue it does. Many will say it doesn’t. I’m one of those that say it doesn’t and I thought it would make a lot of sense to repeal that law. 99  Not only is it an archaic law, one major reason why I believe the law has to be repealed is because many soldiers ride on the law to abuse the rights Nigerians. We have heard numerous cases of Nigerians being beaten for wearing the camouflage.  I decided to put together a bill so we can repeal this law but I gathered that a distinguished Senator has already submitted a similar bill. I will be waiting for it’s progress. If nothing happens in a few months, I will push mine. For now, I wait. 411   SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
