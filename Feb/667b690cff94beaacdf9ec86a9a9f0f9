Residents of Lagos State under the aegis of #OccupyLagos on Saturday stormed the streets to protest the hardships brought on them by the recent ban by the state government on motorcycles (okada) and tricycles (keke Marwa) in the state. The protesters bearing different placards stormed Eko Atlantic which is the finish line of the 2020 Lagos City Marathon that held on Saturday.  Inscriptions on the placards include; “Better roads, less traffic”, “you do not build a megacity by hiding the poor”, “railway? rail, where?” “this is ferry wrong”, “BRT fit enter my street”, “regulate, not ban”, “Okada/Keke Ban: Day 8… Wia D alternatives dey?” “Children are walking, students are walking, workers are walking, Lagos is walking”. The protesters also took to Twitter to record their grievances on the restrictions. Below are some of the tweets from #OccupyLagos . Made this while I was seated in traffic for 5 hours. Lagos is doing the most. #OccupyLagos #OkadaBan pic.twitter.com/u60Nh9Nndq — Eniola (@korty_EO) February 8, 2020  #OccupyLagos is live at the marathon finish line at Eko Atlantic. Strictly peaceful, law-abiding and orderly. The message is clear: we do not want a policy that does not work, we do not want a policy that makes life difficult for Lagosians, #RegulateNotBan bikes and tricycles. pic.twitter.com/EInzGlK85f — #OccupyLagos Mocha (@raychellered) February 8, 2020  ALSO READ: Razed Ayede Substation: TCN surprises residents, restores power under 24 hours If you want to join #OccupyLagos, please come to the marathon finish line at Eko Atlantic. #OccupyLagos #OccupyLagos #OccupyLagos #OccupyLagos pic.twitter.com/lEDproRhjr — #OccupyLagos Mocha (@raychellered) February 8, 2020  Bala Mohammed tasks LG caretaker chairmen on service… Support Abiodun’s administration with prayers, we only… FG commends Kano over establishment of cancer centre South West Houses of Assembly get Amotekun bill coming week Message for Nigerian politicians as today's protest of #OccupyLagos comes to an end.
