A group, Centre for Africa Liberation and Socio-Economic Rights (CALSER), on Wednesday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to forthwith declare a state of emergency in Borno State, even as it condemned in its entirety the renewed spate of insurgents attacks in the state. The group made the call while addressing newsmen in Abuja, expressing its displeasure with the latest attack in Auno community where it said some unscrupulous elements elected to set vehicles, building and human beings on fire for no justifiable reason. “This act is not only an affront to our collective sensibilities as a people; it indeed speaks volumes of some conspiracy theory that does not want the war against Boko Haram terrorists to come to an end so they can continue to hide under that cover to fleece the people of their commonwealth,” CALSER said. Convener of the group, Princess Tosin Ajibola, while calling for a state of emergency in a statement read to newsmen, titled: “The Urgent Need for the Declaration of A State of Emergency in Borno State,” said this was necessary for the relevant authorities to get to the root cause of the renewed terrorist activities in the state. Ajibola wondered why Borno was overly targeted for renewed insurgent attacks despite the concentration of troops in almost all the communities in the state, saying that should the state of emergency be declared, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum must be made to step down to allow for full presidential powers to restore peace and security in the state and to also allow the deprived and exploited people of Borno State some relief.

The time to act is now,” Ajibola affirmed. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
