The National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA) has charged the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) on the need to utilise the 7% Port Development Levy to create navigable channels on the waters for cargoes to be transferred to Kirikiri Lighter Terminal. The President of NCMDLCA, Mr Lucky Amiwero who said this in a chat with newsmen recently, reiterated that the move will help reduce pressure from the congestion in Lagos ports. According to Amiwero, “the part of NPA’s collection of 7 per cent port Development Levy, should be utilised to create navigable channels and berthing facilities, so as to move cargos from the wet port to the Kirikiri Lighter Port, which will help to ease the pressure from gridlock.

Amiwero however called for a state of emergency on Lagos ports which, according to him, will help to wave the complexity of the lease agreement with the empty terminal owners at Kirikiri. “The state of emergency is to wave the complexity of the lease agreement with the empty terminal owners at Kirikiri Lighter Port and the cargo traffic elements on the concession agreement with concessioners” “This is to enable the faster movement of more containers from the wet Ports within Lagos by barges to the Kirikiri Lighter Port, which will eventually prevent international and local litigation on the deviating of cargos to other ports, which is not port of destination in contract of carriage” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
