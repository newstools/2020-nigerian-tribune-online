President of the Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide, Pastor Abraham Akinosun, has queried why the Federal Government appeared to be protecting persecutors of Christians in the country. Akinosun said this at a vigil held recently in memory of the first president of the church, Oba Isaac Akinyele, who was also former Olubadan of Ibadanland. Akinosun, who lauded the spiritual endowment of the late cleric, lamented over the persecution Christians are currently facing in Nigeria. ‘2.5 million Northern children endangered by malnutrition’ Buhari has breached Armed Forces Act in retaining service… Lawyers divided over de-registration of 74 parties Amotekun personnel to carry licensed firearms —South-West… According to him, “persecution in the olden days was from the orthodox churches, but the 1930 mighty revival of the CAC humbled the unbelievers that they submitted all they called god. “But these days, persecution is coming from the government though not directly. Our governments are shielding the persecutors and this should not be. The president should make the appointment of security officers to be evenly distributed. “But now, everyone can see that it seems the government of this country is executing OIC Charter. This is because in any country that executes OIC agenda, all officers must be Muslims. And if you look at it now, all security officers, including Police, Army, Air Force are all Muslims. It is the same with all other departments like Customs, Immigration and the rest,” Akinosun said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
