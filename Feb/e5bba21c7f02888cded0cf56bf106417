According to him, the projects would be of national priority and devoid of political encumbrances. In his response, the Managing Director FERMA, Engr. Nuruddeen Rafindadi who commended the gesture, however, lamented the poor state of roads as a result of poor funding. According to him, budgetary allocation has been grossly inadequate to fund road repair works. He said:”when the Ministry of Finance approves the loan arrangement, AfDB should be assured of good execution of the job. Some of the Roads that would benefit from this may not be viable for Privatization, because of low traffic density, but they are important due to their connection to rural areas with heavy Agricultural activities.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
