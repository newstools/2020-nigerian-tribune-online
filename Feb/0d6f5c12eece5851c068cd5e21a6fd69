Stakeholders across Anambra State have commended both the Federal Government, Court of Appeal President, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa and Anambra State government for their roles in bringing the court of Appeal nearer to the people. They made the commendation during the inauguration of the Appeal Court in Awka, the Anambra State capital, on Wednesday, by Justice Bulkachuwa. A legal practitioner, based in Awka, Barrister John Okoli Akirika, said the presence of the appellate court in the state will save people the cost of having to travel to Enugu frequently in large numbers to obtain justice. For a state chairman of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Demian Okeke-Ogene, while appreciating the Federal Government effort on the ongoing construction of Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway and the Second Niger Bridge, said the decision to have a division of the appeal court in Anambra was a welcome development because of the calibre of people in the state. He commended Governor Obiano on his judicial achievement in the state, describing him as a man of foresight and commitment. A Lagos based Legal practitioner, Mr Frank Ndibe, said the Honourable Justice Bulkachuwa is one jurist reputed for a powerful sense of justice and is committed to service delivery while Mrs Amaka Ezeno also expressed gratitude to.

Justice Zainab Adamu Bulkachuwa, in her address, during the inauguration, assured that it would focus on bringing accountability and quick dispensation of justice with neither fear nor favour. Bulkachiwa, who said the new division would not only help to decongest cases at Enugu Division of Appeal Court but shall bring justice closer to people, stressed that its panel members were thoroughly selected and comprise of dedicated Justices. She, however, regretted that even though Court of Appeal had recorded an increase in numbers rising from 3 divisions in 1976 to 20 in 2020, its budget envelope was static, and appealed for improved budgetary allocation for optimum service delivery. On his part, the Anambra State Acting Chief Judge, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu, described it as a milestone in the history of the state and a relief to the litigants who travel from Anambra to Enugu in search of justice. The Presiding Justice of the newly established Court of Appeal, Justice C. E. Iheme, commended the initiative, adding that Awka Court of Appeal was set to act as the last hope to “everybody,” as well as “call a spade its name (spade), without messaging anyone.” Earlier, Governor Willie Obiano, said his administration had not relented in strengthening the relationship between the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary due to their enormous importance in a democratic setting. He added that why Appeal Court is necessary in the state, was because over seventy per cent cases at the Enugu Division of the Court originate from Anambra state. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
