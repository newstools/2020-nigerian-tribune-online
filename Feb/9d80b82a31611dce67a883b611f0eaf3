A prominent member of the defunct National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), Colonel Tony Nyiam (retd), said President Muhammadu Buhari has consistently breached the Armed Forces Act and that he ought to have changed the current service chiefs long ago. Speaking against the backdrop of the security challenges in the nation, Nyiam, in an interview with Sunday Tribune at the weekend, contended that the Federal Government had left so many things undone with regard to the security of the country and its people. ‘2.5 million Northern children endangered by malnutrition’ Lawyers divided over de-registration of 74 parties Amotekun personnel to carry licensed firearms —South-West… Security chiefs should have been changed long ago —Colonel… “The change should have been done months ago.
