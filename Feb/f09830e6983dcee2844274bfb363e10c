Gombe State House of Assembly has been urged to see to the need of creating a sustained budget line for the prevention and treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in the state as well as intensify overweight function in the implementation of the budget and policies of nutrition and family health issues. The call was made on Wednesday by the Executive Director of an NGO, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Ibrahim Rafsanjani while making welcome remarks at a one-day retreat organised for members of  Gombe State of Assembly held at Chartwell Hotel, Bauchi. The Executive Director who was represented by the Head of Monitoring and Evaluation of CISLAC, Lovelyn Arbor also said that the main objective of taking House members away from their comfort zones was to have their undivided attention so that they could have a deeper knowledge on the current challenges around SAM in Nigerian and Gombe State in particular and explore avenues on how they could fast track appropriate measures to change the current trend in the State.

Ibrahim Rafsanjani added that “The survey also indicated that Nigeria records 361,000 deaths from SAM yearly, which translate to 1000 deaths per day, a development he laments is pathetic and must not be allowed to continue considering that it will have a negative impact on the manpower and economic development of the society.
