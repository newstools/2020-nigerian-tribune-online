The House of Representatives, on Thursday, urged the Federal Government to grant operational rights to Bayelsa airport which was recently completed by the State Government at the cost of N60 billion. The resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion brought under urgent national importance sponsored by Hon. Ndudi Elumelu; Hon. Peter Akpatason; Hon. Toby Okechukwu; Hon. Gideon Gwani; Hon. Fred Obua and Hon. Preye Oseke. In his lead debate, Hon. Elumelu, who applauded the efforts of the Bayelsa State government on the completion of the N60 billion airport in February 2019, noted that the airport has a runway of 3.7 kilometres (one of the longest in the country) and have a capacity of providing about 2,000 formal and informal jobs for the indigenes of the state. He explained that the airport was constructed with a whopping sum of N60 billion of taxpayers money and it has some of the best and latest equipment in the aviation industry.

In the bid to fast-track the process, the House urged Federal Government to direct NCAA and Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to immediately grant Bayelsa airport the operational right. In the same vein, the House mandated its committee on Aviation to follow up and ensure compliance and report back within four weeks for further legislative action. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
