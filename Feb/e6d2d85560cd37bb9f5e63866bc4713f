Renowned cleric and pastor-in-charge of Evangelical Church of Yahweh, Primate Theophilus Olabayo, has called on governors of South-West states to remain focus for  their security apparatus to succeed. The cleric also warned politicians that are heating up the polity ahead of 2023 elections to be mindful of the plans of God for the nation. Olabayo, while speaking with Churchnews, said: “Amotekun is long overdue. The whole North is a no-go area. From Bauchi to Yola and other places, the governors now stay in Abuja to rule their states. In Kaduna, the roads there have been taken over by bandits.

I don’t know why a good government will not support the initiative. We are concerned. For somebody like Gani Adams to volunteer himself to be part of the security outfit, it shows that we are not safe. The South-West governors should support him. They should give him the necessary support and funds to succeed .The obas must support him . “The governors should set up the outfit properly. They should mobilise themselves as well and should not play hide and seek game with Amotekun. There should be no Judas among them, including external control. “President Buhari should be happy with the development. We need community policing and is community policing. Everybody should embrace it,” he added. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE TO GET IT!!!
