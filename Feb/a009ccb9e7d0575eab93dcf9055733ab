THE All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South West has said it has not approved the appointment of former Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, as the deputy national chairman of the  party. The position became vacant following the appointment of Chief Niyi Adebayo as the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment by President Muhammadu Buhari. Zonal publicity secretary of the APC, Mr. Karounwi Oladapo, in a statement on Friday said media reports announcing Senator Ajimobi should be disregarded by the public.

The statement reads, “The attention of the leadership of the south west Caucus was drawn to a misleading media reports that the South west Caucus approved the appointment of Senator Abiola Ajimobi as the Deputy National Chairman of APC at the Osogbo meeting of the APC leadership. “It was a complete falsehood as nothing like that happened in the said meeting. Members of the public and APC members should disregard such claims. How can the leadership caucus in Abuja ratify a nonexistent endorsement and approval? As the zonal publicity secretary, statutorily responsible for dissemination of news and information from the zonal caucus, I did not issue any statement after the Osogbo meeting because I was not authorized to so do. “Once again, I will like to reiterate the statement of the national vice chairman South West and the chairman of the South West zonal caucus, Pastor Bankole Oluwajana, that the party never approved nor endorsed any candidate at its Osogbo meeting and that the APC national leadership will resolve who among Senator Gbenga Aluko and Senator Abiola Ajimobi will occupy the vacant seat at the appropriate time.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
