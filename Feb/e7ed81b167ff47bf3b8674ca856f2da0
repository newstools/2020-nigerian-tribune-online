San Leon Energy is planning to develop an alternative crude evacuation infrastructure in direct response to frequent breaches on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL). San Leon said the new export route in Nigeria would be innaugurated in May. The alternative crude oil evacuation and storage system (ACOES) will allow oil from OML 18 to be carried to the sea, where it will be loaded on to a dedicated floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel, ELI Akaso.

(SPDC), in line with statements from Aiteo Group. “The operation of ACOES is expected to be a major catalyst for the success of OML 18. We have long described the challenges to pipeline losses and downtime on the existing NCTL pipeline and ACOES is expected to reduce both significantly,” said San Leon’s CEO, Oisin Fanning. The ELI Akaso is expected to arrive at Bonny port shortly, the company said. Energy Link Infrastructure (ELI) has told Eroton Exploration and Production, the operator of the licence, that mobilisation to the site should begin this month. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
