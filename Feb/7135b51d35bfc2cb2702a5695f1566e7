The Ogun State House of Assembly has sought for inter-agency collaboration among security agencies in the state, to boost security situation following the ban on commercial motorcycles (okada) and tricycles (keke Marwa) in some parts of Lagos State. This move according to the Speaker of the House, Hon. Olakunle Oluomo, would help in checkmating any form of crimes and criminalities that might arise as a result of the influx of riders into the state. Oluomo who was responding to the submissions of his colleagues, Honourables Adegoke Adeyanju, Sikirat Ajibola and Wahab Haruna, under personal explanation during plenary held at the Assembly complex, on Tuesday, urges residents to be security conscious in their daily engagements.

The Speaker also called on the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to as a matter of urgency, intervene in the plight of the people living in the border areas to control the overzealousness of security personnel, which had been inflicting untold hardship on business owners and residents. He urged the leadership of the State Security Trust Fund to realign the allocation of vehicles and other operational logistics to include all parts of the state, so as to reduce crimes and criminalities to the barest minimum.
