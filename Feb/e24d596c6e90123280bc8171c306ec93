Towards tackling unemployment in the country, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has trained 140 youths from all parts of Nigeria in its National Youth Empowerment Programme on vocational training in tailoring and fashion design. The training held at the National Youth Development Centre, Odeomu, Osun State, for 21 days where the trainees were grilled on the art of sewing clothes. Minister of Youths and Sports, Mr Sunday Dare, who spoke at the closing ceremony of the training through Mrs Lere Adams, said that the programme will not only ensure economic progress but also promote national progression as crimes would reduce when youths are engaged. He mentioned also that to achieve the national economic developmental growth and recovery plan in Nigeria, youths have to be strategically invested in.
