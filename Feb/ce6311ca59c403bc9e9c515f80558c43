A FORMER Publicity Secretary of the Edo State branch of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Godwin Erhahon has taken a swipe at some members of the ruling party who blame the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole for the loss of already won Bayelsa State Governorship seat to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The Supreme Court had in a landmark judgment last Thursday disqualified the governor-elect less than twenty-four hours to his inauguration on the ground that his deputy presented fake credentials. Erhahon, a former Edo State Chairman of defunct Congress for Progressive Change, CPC said in Benin that only mischief makers would blame Oshiomhole for the error in the credentials of a candidate who was screened and cleared for the election.

He said: “After reading the speech of the National Chairman at the inauguration of the screening committee,  any rational commentator would sympathise with The National Chairman as a victim of sabotage. “Comrade Oshiomhole proactively warned the committee to be thorough in their screening and avoid any loophole that could lead to a judicial voiding of a hard-earned victory. His speech was prophetic.” Instead of the blame game, Erhahon advised he party faithful to wait for the  National Working Committee to obtain explanation from the screening committee and the appropriate National Officials of the party such as the Organizing Secretary and the Legal Adviser whose duties it is to cross-check the credentials of candidates submitted by the screening committee before forwarding same to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
