Following the country’s successful debut green bond issuance of N10.69 billion in December 2017 and N15 billion Series II Green Bond in 2019, Nigeria is set to undertake a third tranche of the green bond programme of up to N25 billion to fund environmental projects. The Minister of Environment, Dr Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, said the proceeds will be used to finance power, afforestation, deforestation water, energy, agriculture among other projects, saying that “we are moving to smart agriculture to produce more foods with minimal impact on the environment.” Speaking at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), on Thursday, the Minister added that the Series III Green Bond issuance would further demonstrate the government’s commitment to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional by 2030, as outlined under the Paris Agreement signed on 21 September 2016.
