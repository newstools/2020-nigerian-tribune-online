The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has called on unemployed graduates to embrace blue/green collar jobs as sustainable alternatives to white collar jobs. He made the call at a town-hall meeting on popularisation of blue/green collar jobs among graduates of tertiary institutions in Nigeria, held in Benin, Edo State. Represented by the Director, Special Duties and Projects Department in the Ministry, Dr Martina Nwordu, the Minister urged Nigerian youth to invest their talent in the blue/green collar jobs sector, stressing that the richest youth in the world were not government employees but those who engaged in creative skills to distinguish themselves.
