Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said his administration is strongly committed to massively invest in quality education to guarantee a brighter future for the young ones, assuring that the state government would spare no effort to improve the learning and teaching environment in schools across the state. Sanwo-Olu restated his commitment at the weekend while speaking at the 2nd High Table and Fund Raising Dinner of the Alumni of the College of Medicine, the University of Lagos where he was conferred with a special recognition award for his contribution to the growth and development of education. The governor, who was represented by his wife and an alumnus of the institution, Dr (Mrs) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu said he remained irrevocably committed to make the right investment to scale up provision of quality education, especially in public schools. “As you might have known, the education sector was allocated the highest percentage in our current’s year’s budget. This prioritisation is in tandem with the T.H.E.M.E’s agenda in which education represent a key pillar. It is also in the realisation of the key role education plays in the 21st century.

The governor said the state government, in furtherance of this, had recently completed the process of massive rehabilitation and renovation of 300 public schools which was the first phase under the public schools’ transformation programme. In addition, he said a training programme for primary schools’ teachers under Eko Excel Initiative was just completed, while the pilot exercise of the school feeding programme tagged “Snack for Thoughts” for pupils in primary 4 – 6 within Lagos Island Local Government was completed a few days ago. “When fully operational, this programme will improve the nutritional intake of the pupils. This would result in improved mental capacity and school attendance. All of these and many more initiative being implemented will result in a significant transformation of the education sector and better future for our state and the country as a whole,” he said. Besides, Governor Sanwo-Olu commended the MEDILAG Alumni for finding him worthy of the award, saying that it would further spur him to invest more in the quality education of the youth and guarantee a brighter future for them. Chairman of the Planning Committee of the MEDILAG Alumni High Table and Fund Raising Dinner Committee, Professor Oladapo Ashiru, in his opening remarks, said Governor Sanwo-Olu was being honoured for the dynamism he had brought to the education sector in the state since assuming office.
