The senator, therefore, called on security agencies to immediately arrest those behind the physical assault and be made to face the full wrath of the law. He sympathized with Ameh over the unfortunate incident and promises to do everything within the ambit of the law to ensure justice is done to serve as a deterrent to others who may want to further engage in such barbaric.
