The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has insisted that the ban on NPK fertilizers remains in force. To this effect, the apex banking sector regulator has directed that no authorised dealer shall henceforth establish form ‘M’ for the importation of any NPK fertilizers or any other variant. Form ‘M’ is a mandatory statutory document to be completed by all importers for importation of goods into Nigeria. In a circular to all authorised dealers and the general public, signed by the Director, Trade and Exchange Department CBN, A.S. Jibrin, the apex bank noted that violators will be sanctioned.

Any further extension has to be approved by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It is therefore mandatory for all importers to complete and register Form ‘M’ with Authorised Dealers at the time of placing orders whether the transaction is valid for foreign exchange or not.
