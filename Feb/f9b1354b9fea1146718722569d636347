Maria Sharapova has announced her retirement from tennis. The five-times grand slam champion and former world No 1 has struggled with chronic shoulder problems and has slumped to 373 in the rankings. In an emotional essay on vanityfair.com, Sharapova, 32, wrote: “How do you leave behind the only life you’ve ever known? How do you walk away from the courts you’ve trained on since you were a little girl, the game that you love – one which brought you untold tears and unspeakable joys – a sport where you found a family, along with fans who rallied behind you for more than 28 years?

Tennis – I’m saying goodbye.” Sharapova won all four grand slams between 2006 and 2012, before adding a second Wimbledon crown in 2014. However, in March 2016 she revealed that she had tested positive for meldonium, which led to a two-year ban – later reduced to 15 months – from the sport. She first became world No 1 in August 2005 and went on to amass over $38m (£29m) in prize money alone. After returning in 2017 she won the Tianjin Open, her 36th career singles title and first since 2015. She told the Guardian of the circumstances behind her failed test: “I felt trapped, tricked, but I figured all I had to do was explain myself. Meldonium had been banned for four weeks. At worst, I had inadvertently been in violation of the ban for less than 28 days. But I soon realised I was running into a brick wall. If I failed to win my case, I could be banned for up to four years. It would be the end of my career.” After a return to the top 30, injuries struck and hampered her participation in tournaments, including the return of a longstanding shoulder problem that required surgery in 2019. Having ended all of 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2012 as the No 1 in the world, and been a top-five player as recently as 2016, she leaves the sport ranked 373rd. The Guardian SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
