There is an imminent power outage in the whole of Oyo State, parts of Ogun and Osun States as the Ayede transmission station of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) in Ibadan was burnt on Wednesday. The early morning fire completely burnt the Transfomer 1B, 150 mva, 330KV/132 Kv located inside the transmission station. The station supplies power to almost the whole of Oyo state, Sagamu in Ogun state and Iwo in Osun state. The inferno, which started at about 7 am, was said to have been as a result of a power surge that led to sparkling and lightening. However, the fire was still burning as at 10.30 am with men of fire services trying to put it out. According to Chief Operating Officer, Ibadan Electricity Distributing Company (IBEDC), Engineer John Ayodele, who described the fire incident as unfortunate, saying “for now, this transformer is part of the four transformers that are being used among Oyo, Osun and Ogun States especially Sagamu and others. Meanwhile, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) stated that Ibadan, Oyo State capital and its environs, would be affected as a result of early morning fire at the Ayede substation.
