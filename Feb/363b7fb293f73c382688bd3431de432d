Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration in Oyo State will continue to partner stakeholders in the education sector, including old students associations, in the development of infrastructures in public schools across the state. Former Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology in Oyo State, who is now overseeing the Ministry of Establishment and Training, Professor Daud Sangodoyin, stated this during the inauguration of a block of four rehabilitated classrooms and sets of furniture by the old students association of Ahmadiyya/Anwarul Islam Grammar School, Eleyele, Ibadan. The commissioner, represented by Aminat Atere, stated that the rejuvenation of public schools required the concerted effort of all stakeholders with the government at the forefront of the crusade.

Alao, who disclosed that the rehabilitation of the newly inaugurated block of four classrooms and 128 pairs of desks and benches in the school cost a huge amount of money, said the determination to support the growth and development of the school would remain paramount to the alumni members. “As you are all probably aware, this year’s celebration marks the 65th anniversary of the school which was established on February 14, 1955. “This general-purpose hall was rehabilitated by the old students association after about a decade of abandonment occasioned by the inability of the government and the parents, teachers association to maintain. We appreciate all members of AGSOSA, home and abroad for their sacrifice in ensuring the rehabilitation of the hall that gulped over N8 million,” Alao said. He urged the government to provide more staff for the school in a core subject. “This will help to bring back the glory of the school. The drawings and estimates for the rehabilitation of the dilapidated library, the cost of which is presently at N17million, is available here for all of us to see,” he said. An N17million fundraiser was done at the event for the rehabilitation of the dilapidated library in the school. Also slated for rehabilitation, among others, is the first block of building in the school which was reportedly constructed in 1955. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
