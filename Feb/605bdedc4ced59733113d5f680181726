Former Senator representing Kaduna Central senatorial district, Senator Shehu Sani, who was released by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) on Friday has described his detention by the anti-graft body as unfair and a clear breach of his fundamental human rights. In a press statement signed by Senator Shehu Sani on Saturday stated that his 30 days of incarceration in the hands of EFCC witnessed a very ugly situation which includes traumatising interrogations, searching his houses and offices as well as compelling him to declare his assets. “My incarceration for 30 days in the jail of EFCC was unfair, unjust and a clear breach of my fundamental rights and hence stands condemned. “During my unjust stay in the EFCC cell, I was subjected to traumatising interrogations; My houses and offices were searched. They compelled me to declare my assets. They tried to subject me to polygraph lie detector tests. My accounts were blocked. My phone was seized all in the name of fictional “24” or “25” thousand dollar extortion. “Any information planted in the media by the EFCC spokesperson while I was in their custody about me is outrightly false and nothing but a bacterial and fungal infested concoctions, typical of their style.
