No fewer than 16 Niger Delta groups are demanding the dissolution of the Interim Management Committee (IMC’s) Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), saying their continued stay in office was deepening the level of mistrust among Niger Delta States. In a protest letter to the President of Nigeria, Mohammadu Buhari made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, the groups insisted that forensic audit of the Commission will only be successful when a properly constituted management carries out the task and not a committee made up of politicians with personal and political interests. The protest letter jointly signed by its conveners, Pureh Kalango (National Coordinator, Person Not Party), Secretary, Abiye Achepaka (President, Ijaw Professionals and Entrepreneurs Association IPYED) and Saint Mienpamo Onitsha (State Chairman, PANDLEAF, Bayelsa State), noted that the NDDC Act 2000, as amended, did not make provision for an interim management committee.

On its five-point resolution in the letter to the President, Kalango told journalists that the coalition pointed out that a team would be constituted to meet the National Assembly leadership and engage in massive sensitisation in the media on the need to stop the illegal committee in the NDDC. We have also called on major stakeholders to intervene in the crisis in the NDDC and we are ready to organise peaceful protests in the Niger Delta states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to appeal to the President to end the injustice in the NDDC,” he added.
