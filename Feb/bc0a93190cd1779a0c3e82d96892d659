Oyo State is peaceful and has been for a while just as the issue of 1962 Wild Wild West remains indelible. The issue of sacked local government chairmen and Oyo State governor should be resolved amicably. Let’s borrow a leaf from Ekiti and Ondo where the All Progressives Congress (APC) is in control and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members are council chairmen and both parties are working together peacefully. Let’s look at Bauchi State where the APC are in majority while the governor is from the PDP. The ruling PDP in Oyo State the and APC should bury the hatchet and move the state forward. We are all brothers and sisters. Politics should not divide us; as a pacesetter state, we should lay good examples for other states to follow. The leadership of both parties needs to intervene in the matter to allow peace to reign. The traditional rulers should also play their role to bring about peace.
