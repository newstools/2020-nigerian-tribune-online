The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Sokoto State chapter, has urged security agencies in Sokoto State to buckle up and tackle the security challenges in the state. This was contained in a communique issued at the end of the monthly congress of the union held on Saturday at the press centre and signed by the state union chairman and the secretary, Isa Abubakar Shuni and Abubakar Awwal Imam respectively. The meeting which was well attended by members was presided over by the council’s chairman, Isa Abubakar Shuni, where issues affecting members, union, state and the country at large were thoroughly deliberated upon. The union observed with dismay the risen insecurity, especially in the eastern part of the state and some neighbouring communities in Kebbi and Zamfara States and tasked the security agencies to step up the fight against armed banditry. This was against the backdrop of the recent observation of well-armed bandits roaming in some communities of Isa Local Government Area during the rerun elections recently conducted in Sokoto State unabated despite the presence of security formations in the area.

The union, however, tasked security agencies to use all their might against enemies of peace and their collaborators in the state. While stressing the importance of community policing in maintaining peace, the union cautioned against the proliferation of regional security outfits which could be detrimental to national security. The union commended the Sokoto State government for the implementation of N30,000 minimum wage, urging it to hasten it to resolve all identified problems. It, therefore, appealed to the state government to also implement enhanced allowances to members. The meeting admonished members to abreast themselves with modern journalism and to be more professional and apolitical in discharging their responsibilities. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
