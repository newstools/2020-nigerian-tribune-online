Brig-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has urged corps members nationwide to use their service period to sensitise their host communities on the negative impacts of corruption in the society. The DG stated this on Friday in Kano during a joint road walk, organised by the NYSC, in collaboration with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Kano State Anti-Corruption Agency. According to Ibrahim, if the corps members sensitise members of their host communities, especially in the rural areas, it would contribute immensely to the fight against corruption. “We have no fewer than 350,000 serving corps members nationwide. If each of them can sensitise their host communities by telling them what corruption is all about, many people will get to understand better and shun it. “Therefore, we are calling on the general public to shun any act of bribery and corruption, as it affects our society negatively and tarnishes the image of the country,” he said. According to him, the walk, which took place in all the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has witnessed large participation of corps members, labour unions, civil society organisations and other organisations. Ibrahim explained that the road walk was aimed at sensitising the public on the dangers of corruption in the society while urging Nigerians to work hard to earn their living, devoid of corruption.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Magu’s speech was read by the Head of Kano Zonal Office of EFCC, Mr Akinyene Ezima. According to him, the objective of the walk, among others, is to sensitise and mobilise youths across the country to reject the evils of corrupt practices. “It is also to encourage the youth to be anti-corruption advocates and ambassadors as well as enlisting them to partner with EFCC by providing information and actionable intelligence on fraudsters in their localities. “The new perspective we are exploring is the awakening and mobilisation of youths in our nation to the task of exposing, confronting and tackling the scourge of corruption,” he stated. Also in his remarks, the Chairman, Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Agency, Muhyi Magaji, commended the NYSC DG for leading the walk in the state. According to him, such an action will encourage the youths in the state to have more confidence in the fight against corruption and give their support. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
