Following the first confirmed case of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country, state governors have admonished Nigerians not to spread fake news capable of causing fear and panic. They have assured that they have activated monitoring and quick response infrastructure in their respective states to ensure that anyone who has come in contact with the virus gets prompt attention. These facts were contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday night by the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), which also advised anyone exhibiting symptoms of the disease to self-quarantine and ask for medical attention. Signed by the chairman of the forum and governor of Ekiti state, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, the statement read: “The Nigeria Governors’ Forum takes note of the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case reported in Lagos State, on 27th of February, 2020.
