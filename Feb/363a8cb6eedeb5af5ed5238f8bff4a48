THE Federal Government has approved the sum of N220 billion grant to endemic states to tackle the out-of-school children phenomenon ravaging the country. Minister of State for Education, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, disclosed on Saturday in Yola, the Adamawa State capital in an address at the launch of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) programme in the state. He explained that the fund was a credit facility from the World Bank to Nigeria to be released to the states as a grant to enable them to fight the scourge of out-of-school children as well as strengthen basic education in their respective jurisdictions. Nwajiuba stated that the cardinal objective of the BESDA programme is to increase equitable access for out-of-school children, improve literacy and strengthen accountability at the basic education level. According to the minister, the programme is focused on the 17states in the country, which includes the entire 13 states of the North West and North East geo-political zones as well as Oyo, Ebony and Rivers states. Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Education, Mr Ben Bem Goong, in a statement in Abuja, quoted the minister as saying that the selection of the states was based on the prevalence of the scourge. Speaking further, the minister said, BESDA became effective in 2018 with the commencement of implementation processes at the federal level, adding that all key activities at the federal level to kick- start implementation of the programme by the focus states have been completed.
