Using sophisticated anti-aircraft rifles and GPMG, a group of bandits and kidnappers located in Kuduru Forest, Kaduna State, on Wednesday, shot at a police bell helicopter, with the pilot and co-pilot sustaining various degrees of injuries. The attack on the police bell helicopter came when special operatives of Operation Puff Adder of the Nigeria Police, backed by the Special Forces of the Police Airwing was providing aerial and intelligence cover for the ground troops who launched an offensive on Kuduru forest, which hosts operational camps of the Ansaru Terror Group. However, the injured pilot and co-pilot were able to wriggle their way out of the onslaught to land the aircraft at the Air Force Base, Kaduna. According to Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, Frank Mba, in a statement, the injured officers sustained “non-life threatening injuries” and were in stable condition. The police in the operation however successfully neutralised over 250 “high-profile” members of the Ansaru group who were fingered to be behind series of terror-related violence, kidnappings, gun-running, cattle rustling and other heinous crimes across the country.

The operation was necessitated by actionable intelligence linking terror and criminal elements in the super camp to series of terror-related violence, kidnappings, gun-running, cattle rustling and other heinous crimes across the country. “Unfortunately, during the operation, a Police Bell helicopter, which provided aerial and intelligence cover for the ground troops came under attack from the bandits using sophisticated anti-aircraft rifles and GPMG. Commendably, the pilot and the co-pilot who demonstrated uncommon courage and expertise successfully landed the aircraft at the Air Force Base, Kaduna without further incident.
