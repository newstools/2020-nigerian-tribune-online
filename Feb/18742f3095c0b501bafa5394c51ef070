The House of Representatives on Thursday unveiled plans to investigate the utilization of over N100 billion intervention fund appropriated for Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) in public institutions in Nigeria. The resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion on the ‘Need to investigate the management, disbursement and infrastructure delivery by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund in Public Institutions in Nigeria’, sponsored by Hon. Emmanuel Ukong-Udo. Nigerian Tribune gathered that the total sum of N208 billion was disbursed to Tertiary Institutions in 2019 only. The lawmaker who harped on the need for accountability of public resources, observed that TETFUND was established by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2011 and saddled with the responsibility of managing, disbursing and monitoring Educational Tax for Government-owned tertiary institutions in Nigeria. “The House also notes that Government institutions were poorly funded and the scheme was designed to improve on management of funds disbursed to those institutions and to engage in the rehabilitation, restoration and consolidation of tertiary Education in Nigeria.

To this end, the House mandated its Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to investigate projects delivery in government institutions, with regard to TETFUND funding and also identify core needs and areas in different institutions that require urgent attention and report back within four weeks for further legislative action.
