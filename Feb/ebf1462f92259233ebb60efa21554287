Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that lack of unity within the state chapter of opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will make its dream of taking over Lagos in 2023 “from the path of progressive governance” difficult. The party said this in reaction to a declaration made by the Oyo State governor, Engr Seyi Makinde, who on Thursday said the ruling APC in Lagos should be ready for defeat in the state come 2023. Makinde, as the Chairman, Reconciliation Committee of PDP, was in Ikoyi, Lagos residence of Chief Olabode George, where he had meeting with aggrieved party leaders in the state, with a view to reconciling them.

Seye Oladejo, in a statement made available to the Tribune Online, said it would take more than the “stillborn unity” amongst the warring PDP leaders and members to take over Lagos State from APC, which he noted had been on the path of progressive governance. ”It will take more than the still-born unity amongst gangsters to take Lagos State from the path of progressive governance,” Oladejo said. This was just as the APC chieftain further noted that the party in Oyo State remained strong, reminding that Engnr Makinde ”needs not forget that he leveraged on the storm in the Oyo State APC family” in the last election to become the incumbent ”after series of electoral defeats.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
