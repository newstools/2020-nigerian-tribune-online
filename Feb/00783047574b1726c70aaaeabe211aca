Still basking in the euphoria of his last single’s success entitled ‘Life, Money and Happiness, UK-based Nigerian singer, Oluwaseun Oluyole, fondly called Sean Dampte by admirers, has cleared the air himself, following insinuations from different quarters that he was quitting music for something else. Dampte, as far as music is concerned, has proven his worth both in the UK and Nigerian music industries, with recent hits like ‘Million’, ‘Energy’ and the most recent, ‘Life, Money, and Happiness’, backing them up with exotic and brilliant visuals. While reacting to this insinuation, the Afro fusion singer said that he has no plan to quit music anymore, though he had taken break twice that those times were based on cogent reasons, reiterating that he could have been a professional fashion model or actor if he wasn’t singing.

I think I already quit twice and I still found my way back. So, for me, what’s the point in quitting? When I would still have to return. I am passionate about music and the feelings it gives me and my fans. And more so, the juicy income that follows it,” he said. He, however, added that rather that quitting, he has clear visions of his plans for 2020. “This year, I want to be perfect. Make decisions based on what I see and know rather than what I hope for.” “Part of my strategy is to focus more on the UK scene and see how the Nigerian music scene reacts to it. I also hope to expand my horizons and audience on the Afro fusion scene,” he said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
