The Managing Director, Total E & P, Mike Sangster, on Monday, said about $40 million was spent annually on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Sangster, who stated this in Abuja at the ongoing 2020 edition of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), said various projects were also commissioned in November 2019 in all parts of the country, especially in the North East to alleviate some of the deprivations caused by insurgency in the region. He said with the cooperation of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other partners, the company had contributed in no small measures, especially in the area of youth empowerment; health care delivery, education, sports, and infrastructure development in communities across the length and breadth of Nigeria.
