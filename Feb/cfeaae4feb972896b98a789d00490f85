PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the review of curriculum of Nigerian universities to focus on the development of entrepreneurial skills of students which will ultimately impact greatly on efforts to generate employment and reduce the high rate of poverty in the country. He has also urged Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other staff union of universities to allow stability and uninterrupted academic activities in the institutions for the overall objectives of attaining national development goals with the institutions as pivots. Buhari, who is the visitor to the University of Abuja, spoke, on Saturday at the 24th convocation ceremony of the university, where a total of 10,338 students graduated from different faculties. At the ceremony, Chinenye Ngene received award for emerging the overall best graduating student with first class from the Department of Statistics scoring Cumulative Grade Points Average (CGPA) of 4.83. President Buhari said government would continue in its determination to improve the deteriorating infrastructural facilities in the universities, teacher development, and curriculum review in tandem with the needs of the larger society. He said the National Universities Commission (NUC) has been directed to initiate the process of reviewing the curriculum of universities which would, among other relevant activities, include provision for the minimum level of qualification for university teachers. The president, who was represented by the Executive Secretary of NUC, Professor Rasheed Abubakar, said the renewed drive to reinvigorate the education sector was to generate in the citizens the spirit of creativity and entrepreneurship which would ultimately galvanise the drive towards self-employment. He said: “Education will continue to be a high priority item in my government’s drive to transform the economy. “The task of overcoming the problems of the education sector is not a function and responsibility of government alone. It should emerge through a concerted effort of government, parents, stakeholders and the entire society “Government will continue to provide Nigerians equal and massive access to education at all levels such that they can fulfill their dream of participating in the nation’s socio-economic development and empowerment of our youths.
