It aims to improve their revenue base, increase fiscal efficiency in public expenditure and reduce their debts with a grant of $750 million open to the 36 states between 2018 and 2021, according to their performances. Lee said the states which were declared ineligible for 2018 failed to publish their annual budgets and audited financial statements as stipulated by the Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLI), among others.
