The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has dispelled insinuations that the union is insensitive to the plight of students and parents by constantly embarking on strikes. Dr Lazarus Maigoro, Chairman of the University of Jos chapter of the union, said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Jos. Maigoro insisted that the demands of the union before the Federal Government were aimed at improving the standard of universities in the country. NAN reports that the union has started mobilising its members across the country to embark on industrial action over what it called government’s failure to fulfil the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached with it since 2009. NAN also reports with the news of an impending strike, many parents had decried the incessant industrial action embarked upon by university lecturers and accused ASUU of being insensitive to the dilemma of students and their parents.

Maigoro, however, accused politicians and government officials of being insensitive and treating issues of education with kid gloves and called on the government to act fast in revamping the decaying system. “We are like every other ordinary Nigerian; we don’t have money to take our children abroad. It is the politicians that send their children overseas to school. And that is why they don’t care about improving the system at home because it doesn’t affect them in any way “So, the government must be proactive enough in bringing back the lost glory of education in Nigeria by making the system work through adequate funding and what have you,” he said.
