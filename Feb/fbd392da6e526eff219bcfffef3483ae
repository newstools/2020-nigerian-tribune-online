The President Evangelical Church  Winning All (ECWA), Reverend (Dr) Stephen Panya Baba, has condemned the insecurity in Nigeria coupled with the high level of corruption saying Nigeria is failing and it’s existence at stake. Speaking at the interdenominational service organised by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to mark the end of the prayers and fasting declared by the national body of the Association at the Church of Christ in All Nation (COCIN) in Jos, Plateau State, the Clergyman strongly condemned the posture of the government toward the insecurity ravaging the country and warned that Nigeria future is at stake. “With this myriad of atrocities, our very existence as Christians is at stake, even the existence of our nation Nigeria is at stake, our country is failing. The debt profile of Nigeria keeps soaring with nothing to show for the debt, unemployment is on the increase. Inflation rate in Nigeria is higher than in any other African countries, our naira keeps failing and yet we keep deceiving ourselves that all is well. “Socially, the situation is deteriorating, corruption has continued to get worse. Going by the rating of Transparency International our nation Nigeria is the second most corrupt country in West Africa. Security-wise, the country is falling apart with the high prevailing rate of kidnapping, banditry and other crimes. Human lives no longer mean anything again. In fact, the value of human lives in Nigeria have been made so cheap and value less than that of a cow. The Christians have become endangered species, the church is facing extinction,” he added.

Our only hope for deliverance is God, we can no longer run to God for deliverance anymore because the spirit of Haman is at work in this nation.” In his address the representatives of National President of CAN Reverend Ayokunle, the Association Director of Legal and Public Affairs, Evangelist Sam Kwamkur expressed disappointment that the Federal Government is yet to get to the root of the senseless killings in the country.
