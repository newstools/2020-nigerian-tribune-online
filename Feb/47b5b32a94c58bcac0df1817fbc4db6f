Following the controversy over the armed robbery attack in Dambam LGA of Bauchi State, three suspects have been arrested by state Police command. The command also debunked a report insinuating that the recent armed robbery attack was perpetrated by police officers in the area. While addressing journalists on Wednesday at the Command headquarters, the state Police Commissioner, Philip Maku, explained that the Police have been able to arrest three of the suspects behind the robbery. He said that, “it may interest the general public to know that discreet investigations in the case had led to the arrest of three suspects as follows; Shehu Abdullahi, 20 years, Babawuro Jauro Sani, 27 years and Wada Wakili Musa.” The CP added that, “the above mentioned suspects conspired with seven others now at large on 18/02/2020 at about 3 am armed with Dane guns, machetes, sticks, knives and other dangerous weapons, barricaded the Kano-Maiduguri federal highway with logs of wood and attacked a Sharon vehicle with registration number XA-300-ABS conveying passengers travelling from Kebbi to Maiduguri and robbed them of their belongings.” BREAKING: Soldier shoots four colleagues dead, commits… Incessant accidents: Lagos govt warns truck drivers against… Ikpeazu emerges PDP Governors’ Forum vice-chairman JUST IN: Tambuwal chairs first PDP Governors’ Forum… ALSO READ: FEC okays N30bn road contracts to Niger Republic border Maku also noted that sequel to the investigations into the audio aired on an international radio station and injurious comments on Facebook against the Police as been responsible for the armed robbery attack.
