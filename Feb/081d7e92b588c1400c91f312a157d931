Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is the ‘front runner’ to stage Anthony Joshua’s homecoming fight with Kubrat Pulev in June. Britain’s heavyweight star is close to agreeing a deal to face Bulgarian Pulev, the IBF mandatory challenger, and Joshua has requested a London venue for the next defence of his WBA, IBF and WBO titles. The Emirates and Twickenham Stadium were also under consideration, but Tottenham Hotspur’s 62,000-seater home has emerged as the most likely location. “We’re very close. I had a meeting with AJ last night,” Hearn said in an interview. “We’ve had offers in from the Far East, Middle East, Africa, America, Turkey. “He’s made it very clear to me, I want to come home. I want to box in London next. I’ve been to Madison Square Garden, I’ve been to Saudi Arabia, bring me home. Forget the other offers, bring me home. “He wants to fight in London in June. We’re on the verge of making that happen now. Spurs is the front runner and that’s what he’s asked me to do. We’ll be delivering that for him.” FIRS, multinationals set for war over $10bn annual tax leak Police recruiting volunteers into IGP’s security initiative… We didn’t endorse Ajimobi as deputy national chairman… Why I won’t interfere in Ganduje, Sanusi rift —Buhari ALSO READ: Amidst recent frustration, Lionel Messi set to remain at Barcelona Joshua had also been ordered to fulfil his WBO mandatory title defence against Oleksandr Usyk, but Hearn hopes the Ukrainian will instead fight Derek Chisora, while Dillian Whyte is poised to battle Russia’s Alexander Povetkin. “It looks like Usyk against Chisora is almost there. It’s going to take place a few weeks later than anticipated. It looks like terms are agreed for Dillian Whyte against Povetkin. We’ve got to find a home for that. “UK fight fans, over this summer you’re going to get Joshua against Pulev, Usyk against Chisora, Whyte against Povetkin. Get ready for the announcements. “It’s a big summer of boxing coming for UK fight fans, led by of course, the biggest star in the sport, finally returning home to London in June.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
