The Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital has upheld the judgment of a High Court which handed down a 12-year jail term to a former Chairman of the Governing Council of Kwara State Polytechnic, Dr Saadu Alanamu. Dr Alanamu, who was nominated into the board of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in 2017 but was later dropped on an allegation of corruption, had earlier been found guilty of collecting N5,000,000 bribe from a contractor friend of his as kickback for the award of a contract and was consequently sentenced to 12 years imprisonment without any option of fine by Honourable Justice Mahmud Abdulgafar of Kwara State High Court 9.
