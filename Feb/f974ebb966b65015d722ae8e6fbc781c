A chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Hon Adekunle Akinlade, has asked the people of Ipokia Local Government and Ogun State, in general, to support the present administration in the state with prayers, urging them to put in efforts to make the state great. Akinlade made the request during the 2020 inaugural meeting of the All Progressives Congress in Ipokia Local government held at the palace of Onipokia. “We cannot engage in rivalry, abuses or anything that brings retrogression to our dear state. We have to pray for them (the present administration) to succeed, as this is not about differences in the party, caucus or ideology but about Ogun State. We have just one Ogun State,” Akinlade noted. He hinted that as much as he still wishes to govern the state, he hopes to govern a better Ogun State.
