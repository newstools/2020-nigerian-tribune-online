The acting rector of The Oke-Ogun Polytechnic, Saki, Oyo State, Mr Kayode Ogunmola, has warned the newly admitted students to face their studies squarely and do away with acts capable of tarnishing the image of the institution and theirs. Ogunmola gave the warning on Thursday during the matriculation of over 2,000 students for the 2019/2020 academic session. He said The Oke-Ogun Polytechnic cherished disciplines and integrity hence, the indecent dressing such as wearing of armless cloth, seductive trousers, slippers, and other ungodly dressings would not be condoned as enshrined in the students’ handbook. He added that it is expected of students to desist from all forms of cult activities while they should respect the rules and regulations of the institution, adding that anyone caught violating the institution’s order would be seriously dealt with.
