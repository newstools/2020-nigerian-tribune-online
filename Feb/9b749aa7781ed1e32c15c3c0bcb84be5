Dr Osagie Ehanire, Minister of Health, says Nigeria is contributing to research for the development of Lassa fever vaccine to proffer a lasting solution to the disease. Ehanire, who disclosed this at a news conference on Tuesday in Abuja, said Lassa fever was preventable and could be treated. He said that the disease could be treated when the patient presented himself early to the health care facility. “It is important that Nigerians maintain personal hygiene, environmental hygiene and food hygiene by storing their food properly to prevent the disease.’’ According to him, there has been an increase in the number of Lassa cases reported across the country.
