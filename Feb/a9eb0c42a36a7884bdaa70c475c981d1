The First Lady, Aisha Buhari, on Wednesday, solicited for support from development partners and relevant stakeholders to end the spread of tuberculosis in Nigeria. Buhari made the call in Abuja when she received a delegation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Members of ”Stop TB Partnership Nigeria” during a stakeholders advocacy meeting to End Tuberculosis and Non-Communicable Diseases in Nigeria. Represented by the wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo, the first lady said though, ending tuberculosis in a country as big as Nigeria was a huge task, there was a need for multi-sectoral and multi-lateral support to achieve it. ” Nigeria faces a huge burden of tuberculosis. I hope your visit to Nigeria is not to reinstate what we already know, but to assess the progress we made so far and to support us to do better. ” Because TB awareness in the country is still a major challenge, I have been using both the traditional and social media to create more awareness on TB” she said. Buhari expressed confidence that ending tuberculosis required the cooperation and understanding of stakeholders.

He said, in spite of the federal government’s efforts to end tuberculosis, the disease remains one of the major health challenges in the country. ” Our focus is to provide resources to dictate and treat TB patients over the years, so we have to work together to end tuberculosis in Nigeria” he said.
