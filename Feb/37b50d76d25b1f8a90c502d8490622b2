Nigeria Government declared early Friday morning that it would not issue travel ban from China or any other highly infected countries; as it confirmed the first case of Coronavirus disease in the country. Addressing a press conference Friday morning in Abuja, the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, also said the government had already commencing contact tracing on the patient, an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and returned from Milan, Italy to Lagos last Tuesday. The minister said the Government of Nigeria would not consider travel ban for now because it was working with the World Health Organization (WHO), and that the WHO has not given such directive. Until such a directive comes from the WHO, Dr Osagie emphasised that the government would not consider it nor effect such ban. The Minister stated that the government had already started working to identify all the contacts of the patient since he arrived in Nigeria. He, however, cautioned Nigerians not to be panic as the government and its partners would do everything possible to contain the spread of the disease. Specifically, the minister warned Nigerians not to abuse social media and indulge in spreading misinformation that causes tear and panic among the citizen. “The Federal Ministry of Health. through Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, will continue to provide updates and will initiate all measures required to prevent the spread of an outbreak in Nigeria.” He said. Dr Osagie pointed out that the Federal Ministry of Health has confirmed a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in Lagos State, Nigeria on Thursday; adding that it was the first case to be reported in Nigeria since the beginning of the outbreak in China in January 2020.
