The late Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa has been described as a good Christian, teacher and politician, who lived a worthy life committed to the service for God and humanity. The vicar in charge of Bishop Akinyele Memorial Anglican Church, Iwo Road, Ibadan, Ven I. O. Akinade, said this while extolling Senator Akinfenwa’s virtue at the commendation service held for him at the Anglican Church, Tuesday morning. Delivering his sermon, Akinade said the late Senator Akinfenwa as a Christian, teacher and politician lived a purposeful life worthy of emulation, adding that “Baba Akinfenwa committed his life to the service of God, as a steward,” even till he breathed his last at the ripe age of 89 years. The cleric charged all politicians to emulate the legacies of Akinfenwa, who he said as a politician, refused to be corrupted, rather, he served his people and invested in the well being of all around him. Reading from the Scriptures, Galatians 4:4: “But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,” Akinade said, God had already prepared a way for the dead to eternally live with Him.
