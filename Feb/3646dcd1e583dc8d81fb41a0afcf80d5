The Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government has constituted a committee to study and make a full report on Nigeria’s land border closure with her neighbours. The committee headed by President Roch Marc Christian Kabore of Burkina Faso. According to a statement issued on Monday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), the decision to set up the committee was agreed Sunday night in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at an extraordinary session of ECOWAS leaders convened on the margins of the 33rd AU Summit to discuss the issue and other pressing regional matters. It said Nigeria’s Foreign Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, told journalists after the three-hour closed-door session that the meeting attended by President Buhari and chaired by the ECOWAS Chairman, President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger Republic, also discussed West Africa′s new single currency, the Eco, and the situation in Guinea Bissau after the presidential election.

But he is supposed to start very quickly, study the situation from all the affected countries and present his report.’’ On the Eco currency, the Foreign Minister said: ‘‘Nothing has changed in respect of Nigeria’s position’’. He added that Nigeria’s position was that the convergence criteria have not been met by the majority of the countries, therefore there has to be an extension of time on the take-off of the single currency. On Guinea Bissau, the Minister said ECOWAS leaders recognized that there was an appeal of the presidential election result and they are waiting for the Supreme Court decision on the matter.
