However, all the defendants pleaded not guilty to the five-count charges preferred against them by the Police. Counsels to the defendants, Barrister Sina Adeniran and Nurudeen Kareem pleaded with the court to grant their clients bail, contending that they are still presumed to be innocent until proven guilty of the charges. But, the prosecutor, Elisha Olusegun urged the court not to grant the defendants bail, noting that they are likely to jump bail because some of them are not residing within the court’s jurisdiction. Presiding Magistrate, Olusegun Ayilara, thereby ordered that they should be remanded in Ilesa Correctional Centre and adjourned the case to March 6, for hearing of bail application.
