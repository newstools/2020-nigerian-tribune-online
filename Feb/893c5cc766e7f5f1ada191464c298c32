The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has expressed deep shock over what it described as “chilling expose” of recent interception of weaponised drones at the Lagos Airport with the suspect later released together with the said dangerous weapons, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately investigate the matter. SMBLF made the call on Wednesday in a statement jointly issued by Mr Yinka Odumakin for South-West; Gen Cru Ihekire (South-East), Senator Bassey Henshaw (South-South) and Dr Isuwa Dogo (Middle- Belt). The leaders were reacting to a report in Sahara Reporters titled: “Weaponised Drone Intercepted By Military Intelligence At Lagos Airport As Commander Receives Order To Release Suspect,” demanding that President Buhari should immediately order the suspension of Air Commodore U. K Abdullahi and also contain his movement while a Judicial Commission of Inquiry be set up immediately. Abdullah is the Commander of National Air Defense Corps (NADC), Ikeja, who, according to the report, was said to have ordered the release of the suspect and the drones, having allegedly “received a call from some unknown persons.” ALSO READ: Malawi presidency to challenge court ruling overturning vote result Besides, SMBLF also demanded that a UN-supervised mop-up of Nigeria for weapons of mass destruction and other illegal arms that some people may be stockpiling for possible genocide should be carried out. “We call on President Buhari to immediately order the suspension of Commodore U K Abdullahi and contain his movement while a Judicial Commission of Inquiry is set up immediately. “A UN-supervised mop-up of Nigeria for weapons of mass destruction and other illegal arms that some people may be stockpiling for possible genocide,” SMBLF demanded. Speaking on the interception, the leaders, who said their attention was drawn, quoted from the report that, “The incident happened on January 28, 2020, at about 5:00 pm while DMI officers at the cargo section discovered a suspicious package concealed in cartons. “Upon opening the cartons, the officers discovered parts of two highly weaponised drones and the supervisor told the man that brought it into the country to go and report the following day. “Investigation revealed that the following day the man was asked to write a statement after which he was detained.

Y Danjuma, said: “would not make us sleep if he should open his mouth if this is true.” It wondered how on earth would security agents allow weaponised drones allegedly meant for Kaduna State go into the system in a country that raised “fuss over an attempt by other states to employ guards without even dane guns?” “As far as we know weaponised drones can only come into a country with the approval of the president and the end-user must be the country’s armed forces. “Indeed the manufacturer would follow the equipment until it gets to the end-user as it is more or less a lethal weapon of destruction,” SMBLF explained, even as it raised quite a number of posers. “How did these equipment get into Nigeria and the hands of an individual if the story happens to be true? “Whose call would the commander allegedly receive to release the weapons and the suspect? “How many of such dangerous weapons could have been brought into the system illegally by unscrupulous people with the lives of Nigerians in danger? the leaders queried, declaring the occurrence as frightening. “This is frightening,” they declared.
