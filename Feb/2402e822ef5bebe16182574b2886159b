The Oyo House of Assembly has decried the omission of cultural, creative and visual arts among subjects for which teachers are being sought for in the ongoing recruitment by the state’s Post Primary Schools Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM). Noting that Arts as a subject continued to be neglected and was going into extinction, the Assembly urged TESCOM to urgently include vacancy for recruitment of Arts Teachers in the ongoing recruitment exercise to keep alive the subject in the school curriculum. Honourable Oluwafowokanmi Oluwafemi of Ibadan South-West II state constituency identified this imperative in a matter of urgent public importance at Tuesday’s plenary. In advancing his call, Oluwafowokanmi described Arts as a subject that assists in the acquisition of vocational skills help contribute to the economic development of local materials and resources, especially the promotion of small-scale industries. He added that Arts education arouses ingenious talent, supports values and inventive works, acculturation, hence recruitment of Arts teachers will greatly enhance the development of the society.

Meanwhile, worried by the menace of indiscriminate parking in Ibadan, the state capital, the State Assembly has asked the state Ministry of Public Works and Transport and Oyo State Road Transport Maintenance Authority to come up with a statewide policy to ensure parking discipline culture among residents. The Assembly’s concern was drawn from a motion by Honourable Seyi Adisa representing Afijio constituency bemoaning indiscriminate parking of vehicles, especially commercial vehicles. Expedient, according to Adisa, is the need for the state Ministry of Works and Transport to embark on road mapping and lining of all major roads, especially those areas prone to traffic congestion. In addition, the Assembly urged the state Bureau for investment Promotion and Public-Private Partnership to facilitate the engagement of interested investors for the erection of car parks at most critical locations across the state.
