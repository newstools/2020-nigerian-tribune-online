Lagos based human rights activist and lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), on Wednesday gave support to the ban on Okada operations in some areas of Lagos by the government and also asked that alternatives be provided to ease the burden of commuters because of the traffic gridlock that has recently engulfed the state. Adegboruwa in a statement said that the partial restriction has advantages based on issues of security and environmental hazards, adding that security of life is surely more important than the temporary inconvenience that may attend the restrictions.

Whereas I support the partial restriction in some areas of the State especially the highways and urban areas, it is important that sufficient alternatives are provided to ease the burden of commuters, given the traffic gridlock that has recently engulfed the state. “Reports of robbery, violence, accidents and other social vices associated with motorcycles especially, cannot be ignored. The environmental impact of motorcycle and tricycles also lend credence to the restriction. I, therefore, urge the government to provide viable and durable alternative means of transport so as to alleviate the burdens of the people that may be a consequence of the partial restriction. “The security of life is surely more important than the temporary inconvenience that may attend the restrictions. I, therefore, urge that the restrictions be maintained and viable alternative means of transport should be provided to alleviate the sufferings of commuters,” Adegboruwa said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
