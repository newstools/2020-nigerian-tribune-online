The Kogi Government, on Wednesday, restated its commitment to improving public schools and revamping the education sector for optimal performance in the state. The Commissioner for Education Science and Technology, Mr Wemi Jones, gave the assurance during unscheduled visits to the Government Secondary School, Itobe and the Local Government Science Secondary School, Ajaokuta. Jones said that the enormity of challenges facing the sector necessitated his visit to the schools, to get first-hand information before settling down with relevant stakeholders to proffer solutions. He assured that the Gov Yahaya Bello-led administration remained committed to revamping the sector. He said the government and teachers must be on the same page in order to meaningfully engage the students in robust academic activities and sports competition among others.
