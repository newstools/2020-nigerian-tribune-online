IMMEDIATE past governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi has been appointed as the deputy national chairman (south) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He is to replace the former governor of Ekiti State, Otunba Niyi Adebayo who is now the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment. The appointment, it was gathered was reached at Tuesday’s caucus meeting of the southwest APC which held in Osogbo and ratified by the party’s leadership caucus in Abuja on Wednesday. His appointment has thus generated mixed reactions among the party faithful in the state. While some members have decided to keep mum over Ajimobi’s new status, others have come out to knock and appraise the former governor’s appointment. A former Minister of Communications, Barrister Adebayo Shittu on his part condemned the choice of Senator Abiola Ajimobi as the new New Deputy National Chairman South of the All Progressives Congress (APC). 90 per cent Muslims comment: Apologise for your statement,… Protest rocks APC South-West caucus meeting in Osun Adelabu calls for caution over Oyo LG crisis Lagos APC tackles Jimi Agbaje over comments on Okada, Keke… Although there was mini protest against his choice by party delegates from Ekiti state who argued to present another nomination from the state, Shittu, who had a long political rivalry with the former governor of Oyo State described Ajimobi’s choice as bad luck for the party. According to Barrister Shittu,  Ajimobi’s choice is a “very bad luck for our dear party, APC, in Oyo State and South-West Nigeria as a whole.
