The newly crowned Alapomu of Apomu, Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi on Friday received the staff of office from the state governor, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola, declaring that he is a direct descendant of Giesi ruling house in Ile-Ife. He said “some people might be wondering about my style of dressing here today. It is deliberate to show my roots as my father came from Ile-Ife to settle here in Apomu some centuries ago.” Oba Afolabi, who was crowned by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi explained that “I am from Gbegbaje branch of Giesi ruling house, my great uncle was the 40th Ooni of Ife, who reigned between 1823 to 1835.” While crowning Oba Afolabi as the new Alapomu of Apomu, Oba Ogunwusi described Apomu as a very important part of Yorubaland with Ile-Ife as its source. According to him, “this town remains a very important part of the Oduduwa territory not only because of its direct link to the creation of Ile-Ife but also for the strategic roles Apomu had played in the past in Yorubaland. That’s why Alaafin is here, Olofa is here, Akinrun is here, Oluwo is here and several monarchs.” Trump’s travel ban is ethnic cleansing Election of new ASUU leaders in LASU irrevocable ― VC Sultan chides Northern elders, says Operations Shege Ka Fasa… IPAC kicks as INEC deregisters 74 members Oba Ogunwusi eulogized the newly coronated Alapomu as a well educated fine gentleman and as an embodiment of Oodua cultural values who is readily competent to take Apomu to greater heights.
