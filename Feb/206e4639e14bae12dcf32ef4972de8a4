The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, on Tuesday, described the allegation that he punched Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhikirulahi Akinropo, during a peace meeting at the office of the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police, Zone 11,  at Osogbo last Friday, as untrue and baseless. He declared that “I did not punch Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhikirulahi Akinropo at any peace meeting, I’m fighting corruption in a traditional way,” saying they only had an altercation which they were able to handle. Addressing a press conference in Osogbo, Oba Akanbi explained that his intent in defending the helpless poor will judge him, just as he argued that most of his critics are oblivious of the hardship some monarchs in his domain were inflicting on their subjects. According to him, some monarchs, who were antagonising him from Iwo axis, had lorded themselves over their subjects, usurping family lands and selling with impunity and imprisoning anyone who attempted to challenge them.

They are not happy because they know I’m trying to liberate my people from these kings who have been gaining pleasure in selling their future. “I’m fighting Corruption in a traditional way.
