Stanbic IBTC Capital Limited, a subsidiary of the Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, has established a N300 billion Domestic Bond Programme for the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank). The establishment of the debt issuance programme in the Nigerian capital market by Afreximbank makes it the third supranational ever to join an elite group of Nigeria’s development partners, enabling the domestic capital market. It is vital to establish the Bond Programme in local currency, considering the strong liquidity and current low yields in the domestic market. This initiative by Afreximbank aligns with global best practice in treasury management and innovation to stay abreast of evolving market conditions. It will aid in stimulating the expansion and development of Nigeria, through the intervention in various sectors of the Nigerian economy.
