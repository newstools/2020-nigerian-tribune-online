It is a good thing for us in Nigeria; it will save us a lot of money from capital flight. We so appreciate it, thanks for 7 star global and Santos for bringing this to Nigeria. For FAA, we have been a partner for long we want to support us too as it has been in the past, so there are many companies too who want to seek FAA approval.” The President of Santos Aviation limited, Segun Adesanya said the company specialised in the provision of maintenance and interior refurbishing services to both government and privately owned aircraft. According to Adesanya, agents and employees of Santos aviation have professional and technical licences issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States adding that the licences gave their staff eligiblibility to provide similar services on American made and registered aircraft. “Based on our knowledge and experience in the aviation industry, it is our opinion that this sector of the Nigerian economy has a lot of potential for growth. We are aware of the recent steps taken by the Federal Government of Nigeria and some state governments that will boost the growth of the sector”,  Adesanya added.He expressed gratitude to the IATA team and commended the entire Air Peace team for a successful safety audit.
