Pregnant women in Lere district in Tafawa Balewa LGA of Bauchi State have called on the state government to as a matter of necessity extend the free Medicare policy to their area considering their economic situation. Some of the women who lamented that though they heard about the free Medicare for pregnant women and under-five children said that they are not enjoying it in their area. While speaking to newsmen during the official handing over of the newly upgraded Lere PHC on Friday, the women said that any time they visit the maternity for medical attention they were made to pay between N300 and N500 a development they said is making things difficult for them. They added that they are always made to pay for every service provided for them appealing that the government should do something to help them as most of them do not have stable sources of income.

The Executive Chairman explained further that the vulnerable people include all physically challenged and very old people while the women are pregnant ones, for ANC, Post-Natel, immunization and U-5 children stressing however that it must be at state-owned health facilities across the state.
