THE Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Ibadan branch, has called on the contractor handling the Moniya-Iseyin road construction to ensure prompt completion of the project. The Vice-Chairman of Ibadan NSE, Mr Adekunle Olaoye, made the call when he led other members of the society on an inspection tour of the road project recently. “We are on this technical/industrial and courtesy visit to the construction site because of the new award of the contract so that we can also avail ourselves with the new conditions of this contract which we know is completely different from the previous one of which the present administration in the state revoked.

We still expect that the contractor will keep it up and possibly increase the pace of work in order to ensure prompt completion of the project.” Also speaking with the Tribune Online, Assistant Director of Highways, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Mr Olajide Fadare, said the contractor is on top of the situation. “I do not have any doubt that the contractor will complete the project within the time stipulated for the construction of the road.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
