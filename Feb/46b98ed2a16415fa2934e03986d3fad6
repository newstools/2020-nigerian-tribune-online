Iran announced on Friday the closure of all schools for three days from Saturday because of concerns about a coronavirus outbreak that has killed 34 people in the country. The Islamic Republic had already cancelled Friday prayers in the capitals of 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces because of the outbreak, including in Tehran and the Shi’ite Muslim holy cities of Qom and Mashhad. “Based on assessments it was felt that there was a need for closing all the schools in the country and for this reason all the schools in the country will be closed for three days starting from tomorrow,” Health Minister Saeed Namaki said. “We have a relatively difficult week ahead…as we see the trend, the main peak of the disease will be in the next week and coming days.” The health ministry’s spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, went on state television to announce the latest death toll and said 388 people were also infected by the virus. The vast majority of infections were in three provinces: Tehran, 128, Qom, 88, and Gilan, 65, according to a map published by the official IRNA news agency citing health ministry figures. Those infected in Iran include Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi and Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president for women and family affairs.

Saudi Arabia has reported no deaths or infections and has tightened travel restrictions to try to prevent it spreading across its borders. The United States asked its military in Saudi Arabia to avoid crowded venues including malls and cinemas as coronavirus was reported spreading in neighbouring countries, according to a document from the US embassy seen by Reuters on Friday. Oman on Friday restricted the entry of citizens from other Gulf Arab states who had previously been able to enter by showing national identification cards. (Reuters) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
