An Israeli man who returned to the country from northern Italy earlier this week tested positive for the coronavirus and will be transferred to quarantine at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel’s Health Ministry announced on Thursday. On Friday, the Health Ministry said that the man’s wife was also diagnosed with the virus and is now in isolation. On Thursday afternoon, reports emerged that an Israeli residing in the area of the Coastal Plain had violated the quarantine he is under and went to visit family members.
