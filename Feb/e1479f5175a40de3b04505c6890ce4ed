The founder of Hope Also Need Help Foundation, Honourable Abayomi Fagbenro also known as Bibire, has called on government at all levels to make food security and social welfare their cardinal programmes. Fagbenro noted that there should be a programme that would ensure that citizens, particularly the aged, widows, the unemployed and other vulnerable persons get food, health care and shelter at little or no cost. The founder was speaking at his residence, 1, Fagbenro Close, Adabeji, Oluyole Extension Ibadan. during the free medical outreach, financial support for small scale business owners and widows, free food items and monetary gifts to the aged and disbursement of funds to indigent students for the procurement of JAMB forms organised by his foundation.

Since politics is about service, I joined politics to enable me execute my people-oriented programmes on a larger scale because I hate to see people suffer. I am always guided by the passage in the Holy Scriptures which says what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul? Really, I get fulfilled when I see people around me smiling.” Also speaking, the coordinator/head of logistics of the foundation, Comrade Safiriyu Oludayo, said he was marvelled by the number of beneficiaries from all over the constituency who turned out for the programme. “I am delighted that Honourable Abayomi Fagbenro has put it upon himself to transform lives and give hope to the hopeless. The people here cannot be less than 500. When they started trooping in as early as 6:00 a.m., I saw their faces, but with the medical care and with the tokens honourable has been able to give them, their faces have brightened up. “We organise this programme biannually. You can see for yourself the vast number of beneficiaries here. They are being tested for various health challenges like malaria, high blood pressure, eye defects, and diabetes. “Aside free screening and free drugs, we are also giving free medicated eyeglasses to those that need them.” Also speaking, a widow Mrs Rashidatu Razak commended the founder for giving succour to the underprivileged.
