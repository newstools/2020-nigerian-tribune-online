The Lagos State government has praised the World Bank’s FADAMA III Additional Financing Project for aiding the state in its efforts towards ensuring food security. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, gave the commendation during a meeting with the Implementation Completion Team (ICR) Mission Team of FADAMA in Lagos. Lawal lauded the initiative for its impact in the state, adding that the FADAMA model is worth emulating by various levels of governments as the policy is efficient and productive in improving Nigeria’s agricultural sector.

He further revealed that FADAMA will provide grants transfer for livelihood support, direct and indirect employment, rapid increment in the national food basket and many others.
