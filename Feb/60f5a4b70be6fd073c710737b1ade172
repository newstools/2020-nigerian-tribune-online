Immediate past governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari, has described as baseless, the allegation of gun-running levelled against him by the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governorship candidate in the last general elections, Alhaji Sani Shinkafi. Shinkafi in the petition to President Muhammadu Buhari and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Adamu, which were copied the Vice President, Service Chiefs, Director of DSS and National Security Adviser, demanded the arrest of Yari over alleged threat to peace in Zamfara State. But addressing newsmen on Tuesday, the former Zamfara State governor threatened court action against Alhaji Shinkafi. He further called for the arrest of the APGA candidate whom he claimed was in possession of classified documents.

He said: “The allegations, I can tell you are empty allegations because unfortunately, he called himself a citizen of Zamfara State who contested severally without producing a counsellor, he cannot produce a counsellor. He cannot even be a counsellor, talk less of becoming a governor. “We are going to take him to court, or instead of the IG to ask for me, he (IGP) is supposed to ask him where he got those classified documents. Those documents are classified documents. I’m of challenging him because I am not the Commander in chief, my role as par section 301,302 of the constitution is very clear on what I am able to do as a governor. “No governor in Nigeria have overall control of the state because he does not command any troops, he cannot hire or fire any constable. Therefore if he complains that a certain number of people died, and an innumerable houses burnt, who is in charge of security? It is the President because he’s the Commander-in-chief.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
