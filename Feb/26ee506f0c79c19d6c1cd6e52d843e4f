Abiodun pointed out that both Ogun and Lagos States would jointly work together alongside the Federal Ministry of Health to upgrade the facility. He appreciated the National Centre for Disease Control for paying utmost attention on the state since the case was reported, adding that officials of the FMH are already on ground in the state. The governor added that the state government had distributed a lot of items to all health facilities in the state for the protection of health workers. Abiodun also said that the government is sharing an application with health officers to help them in identifying infected persons, saying the government is deploying a lot of resources to fight the virus. “There is no cause for panic. We are on top of the situation. I am appealing to our people to improve on their personal hygiene. You should not hesitate to alert any nearest health facility in case you identified anyone with coronavirus symptoms,” he added. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
