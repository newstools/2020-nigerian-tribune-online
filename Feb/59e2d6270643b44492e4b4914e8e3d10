Mercy (by E Mail)  Any form of bleeding in a 60 year old woman cannot be a normal physiological activity. Specifically, bleeding from the vagina in a 60 year old woman is abnormal and should be investigated to rule out issues such as Uterine Fibroids, or Cancer. A specialist doctor (Gynaecologist) can investigate her by sending samples of her blood as well as Uterine scrapings to the Laboratory for investigation and appropriate treatment.
