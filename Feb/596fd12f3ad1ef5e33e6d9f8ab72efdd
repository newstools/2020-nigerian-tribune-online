The National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) has in Benin, Edo State,  destroyed illicit, unwholesome, unapproved films and videos worth more than N100 million. The Executive Director of the board, Alhaji Adedayo Thomas before the destruction, said the action was necessary to effectively sensitise the film market for security of investments and protection of the nation’s moral value. Thomas said it was also for the sustenance of national peace, security and harmony. He said that one of the key facilitators of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) of President Muhammadu Buhari administration was the continuous improvement on respect for and enforcement of intellectual property in the film industry. He said that this was through the discouragement of distribution of unapproved, unclassified, and unwholesome films and tackling other illicit activities in the film market. Thomas said that to achieve the desired result, the board went into collaborations with stakeholders across board, especially security agencies. “Our collaborations across board have led to massive confiscation of pornographic films and other unwholesome video works by our Lagos zonal office. And that is why we are here today to carry out the symbolic burning of the confiscated items worth over N100 million.

Meanwhile, Mrs Eniye Asomba, the Head of the Benin centre said the centre was more than committed to actualising the mandate of the board on the state. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
