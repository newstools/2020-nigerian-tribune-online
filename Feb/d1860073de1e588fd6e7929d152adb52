The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo state, on Wednesday, described the three years administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor Rotimi Akeredolu-led government as full of unfulfilled promises. This was contained in a statement issued and signed by the party’s Director, Media and Publicity in the state, Mr. Zadock Akintoye, who described the present administration as abysmal failure saying there was no tangible achievements recorded in all sectors. The party noted that Akeredolu had failed to keep to his promises of transparency, accountability, due process in government expenditure and reforms in key sectors as promised during his electioneering campaign. He said “APC also promised massive investment in road infrastructure, education and health care. Three years after, we are surprised that a government that campaigned on the platter of change would so quickly forget itself. “It is noteworthy that within the last three years, the education sector of our state has been so commercialized that hitherto accessible and low-cost education has now been priced beyond the reach of ordinary citizens, thus the low enrollment at our state-owned higher institutions and the mass withdrawal of brilliant students who had hoped to achieve academic excellence in their own home state. “It is on record that our state-owned schools have witnessed massive withdrawal of students and low patronage since this government came on board. Education is suffering while this government pretends it cares about the people” But while reacting, the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Donald Ojogo, said there was no need to react to the ranting of the opposition party, saying “We won’t desecrate our success” He said “It is perhaps preposterous for us to react to the pains of the PDP in form of an assessment. It’s like desecrating our successes already recorded. “How else do you want to feel when their initial feeling was that Mr. President would not come. We wish to express our deep concern over their fate as a party in the state without a leader. We wish them all the best,” But the PDP maintained that there was nothing to celebrate in the Akeredol- led administration in the state Zadock said “Our health facilities have also become huge revenue-generating platforms from already impoverished citizens who should have found solace in government-funded social services but have now been told, its either you pay or you leave without coming back.
