For many music lovers, the names that usually come to mind in the music industry are Davido, Wizkid or Burna Boy as they have been enjoying massive presence on the music scene. With awards and concerts always at their beck and call, they seem to be the most patronized artists on the music scene but for budding singer, Mamuyoviw Frank otherwise known as Mapatricia his best artiste in Nigeria is 2baba. Speaking with Tribuneonline interview with Sapele, Warri, Delta State-born music artiste, born Mamuyoviw Frank, Mapatricia Ohwerhi, but known on the music scene as Mapatricia appreciates the effort of the trio but remains unshakable on his choice of the best. He said, “Yes, undoubtedly, Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy have been making good music in the last couple of years. Davido and Wizkid particularly and Burna Boy had unprecedented 2019 but all that are not enough to take the shine off 2baba. I don’t feel any qualms to say he is one of the pioneers of Nigerian music. He has remained consistent for more than a decade and still growing stronger. Who else in Nigeria can boast of such relevance over such a long period of time? Of course, Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are ruling their spaces but 2Baba is the pride of Nigeria and indeed, Africa.” Mapatricia cut his teeth on the music scene in 2019 with two banging singles, “ Money Biz” and “Light” and further affirmed his seriousness with another release on New Year Day titled “Demoh.” Mapatricia, while growing up had many influences on his music and development as he grew up in three different countries in Africa, namely; Nigeria, Benin Republic and South Africa. His core genre is Afrobeat but his creativity and background influences allow him to blend into other genres with fluidity and absolute ease.

I started music in the choir in Benin Republic and ever since then I couldn’t stop. I grew up all over the place; Nigeria, Benin Republic and South Africa. It was quite interesting, seeing a lot of diversities; cultures and peoples. It definitely affected my music in so many ways, I tilt towards highlife and soul,” he added, giving an insight to his early life. Speaking further, he revealed he has not released the video of his songs but has many in store. He said 2019 may have been his year of musical birth but 2020 is going to be his year of reckoning as he plans not only to shake the foundation of the music landscape but to emphatically stamp his feet on the terrain. “I am making amazing music, music is everything to me, from creating my music to listening to other songs, music is life. My music is Afro-beats, in one world but I can tilt towards any direction but majorly, it is Afrobeats. Afrobeat is the pride of Africa and Nigeria is already shaping music trends all over the world. It is a movement and I’m glad to be part of that movement. 2020 is my year of reckoning, so watch out for Mapatricia, because he’s coming to rule your space musically,” he said gleefully. “ My inspiration comes from God. Only Him and nothing else makes it happen for me,” he said Before going professional and solo, Mapatricia was a backup singer to Tiwa Savage, Brymo and Femi Kuti. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
