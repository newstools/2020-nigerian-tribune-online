Former governor of Ogun state, Otunba Gbenga Daniel has declared support for the newly introduced park management system in Oyo State. Daniel gave this thumbs up while speaking with journalists after a visit to Governor Seyi Makinde at Oyo governor’s office, Ibadan, on Tuesday. It would be recalled that the Oyo state government had on Monday inaugurated park managers across the 33 local government areas as well as the park managers’ disciplinary committee with duties to ensure proper parking of vehicles, prevent gridlock and help generate revenue internally. Daniel hinged his support for the system on its ability to bring sanity to the parks and professionalise activities of commercial vehicle operators.

I remember that when I was governor I set up something similar to park management system. I set up parks and garages committee, and we tried to ensure that we professionalise what is happening in our parks and garages. “I think it is a laudable idea and I want to plead with all our people to support it. They will turn around all our parks and bring sanity to the parks,” Daniel said. On the establishment of Amotekun corps across states of the South West, Daniel said the launch of the initiative had become expedient owing to recent security challenges facing the zone. “Amotekun is the response of our people in the South West to the various security challenges that we do have nationwide. When you look at what has happened and what is happening, that is the experiences of our people. “I think the Amotekun concept is something whose time has come. As a matter of fact, it should have happened years back. I am very happy that this initiative has come and be rest assured that it has all our support,” Daniel said. Asked if his visit to Makinde was a pointer to his returning to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Daniel responded, “I don’t want to comment about that.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
