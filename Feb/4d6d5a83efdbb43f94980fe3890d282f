President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, night in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, declared that robust cooperation between Nigeria and Ethiopia would provide a strong pillar for African integration. The Nigerian leader, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Wednesday, spoke at a State Dinner. President Buhari noted that such cooperation would give concrete effect to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). He further noted that the two most populous countries on the continent, Nigeria and Ethiopia shared similar challenges, stressing that it has become imperative for both countries to strengthen and expand cooperation at all levels and in all areas. He maintained that his State Visit to Ethiopia, fondly called The Cradle of Humanity, focused on how to further boost relations and explore new areas of cooperation between the two countries. ”Relations between Nigeria and Ethiopia have been warm and cordial since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1964. ”Currently, a Ministerial joint Commission meeting is taking place between Nigeria and Ethiopia to finalise documents for our consideration. ”I am confident that the meeting will produce a fruitful outcome which will elevate relations to a higher level,” he said.
