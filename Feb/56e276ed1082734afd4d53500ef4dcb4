Teachers , parents and other stakeholders have been called upon to help pupils follow career paths that will in future make them become solutions to problems that are inherent in their immediate environment. The Director of Budding Acorns International School, Mrs Titilayo Ogunmola, made the charge in Lokoja on Thursday while declaring open the school’s 2020 Professional Day. Ogunmola warned parents and teachers to desist from encouraging pupils to follow career paths that merely lead to earning a living, saying that they should be brought up to be solutions to a myriad of problems facing the country and the world at large. She said that many of the jobs around today will disappear over the next 20years, stressing the need for all hands to be on deck to deliver education that is in tandem with the realities of the 21st century. “At Budding Arcons International School, we are committed to ensuring that our pupils are groomed for discovering their purpose from a young age.

According to her, the Professional Day is organised annually to ensure that pupils ambitions are ignited and fanned to flame as they grow. She expressed delight that the efforts of the school had started yielding results as one of its pupil was awarded a six-year full scholarship by Shell Nig. Exploration and Production Company in conjunction with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) based on his score at the 2019 National Common Entrance Examination. Ogunmola said that the theme of this year’s celebration “Becoming Tomorrow’s Solutions” was very apt because of the overwhelming challenges of today and its attendant fears. Speakers at the event, Mrs Joy Onoja spoke on the difference between choosing a career and job while the duo of Miss Ojoma Haruna and Mr Isaac Jegede of the Federal Road Safety Corps gave the pupils road safety tips as well as what it takes to be a road safety official. The event ends tomorrow with visits to the Nigeria Museum of Colonial History and other historical sites in Lokoja. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
