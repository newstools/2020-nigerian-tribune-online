Concerned Nigerian Group, on Sunday, called for a holistic review of the judgement given by the Nigerian apex court, the Supreme Court, on the Imo governorship election. The group, in a statement issued in Abuja by its convener, Comrade Deji Adeyanju, a copy of which was made available to the Tribune Online, berated the apex court for putting itself in a position where citizens would now have to question its judgement, making the revered institution to been seen by Nigerians as fallible. It will be recalled that the Supreme Court had sacked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the 2019 general election in the state, Honourable Emeka Ihedioha for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)’ candidate, Senator Hope Uzodinma. Senator Hope Uzodinma who came a distant fourth with 96,458 votes with no clear chances of being declared winner was surprisingly declared the winner by the Supreme Court.

In a distant fourth was Hope Uzodinma of the APC with 96,458. The group further alleged that it had been reliably informed that the Supreme Court is going to use the same panel that was used to carry out the injustice in the first place to review the judgement. “They’ve decided to fix both Zamfara and Imo review on Tuesday so they can strike a political balance, and no amount of political correctness and expediency can solve the injustice done in Imo where the Supreme Court awarded votes that do not exist to the APC. How can the apex court explain how it awarded votes to Hope Uzodinma of APC beyond a number of registered voters and accredited voters in the election?” “The Supreme Court relied on the supposed fake result sheets that had only APC and PDP on the results sheets when 70 political parties contested the election.” “The attempt of the apex court to redeem its image by gifting the opposition, Bayelsa State will still not correct the injustice done in Imo. The irreducible minimum the Supreme Court can do in ensuring that justice is done in Imo is to ensure that the mistake done by the judges be corrected especially as regards the numbers that are not adding up.,” the group said.
