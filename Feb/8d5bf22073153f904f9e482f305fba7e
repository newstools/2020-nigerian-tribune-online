In the report released on Friday, Dryad Global stated that, “Report indicates that the container vessel, Maersk Team while underway from Pointe Noir to Lagos, is currently under attack at 90 nautical miles, North West Sao Tome. “Two unknown men are believed to have boarded the vessel and two skiffs were seen in the vicinity of the attack. Further reporting suggests that the crew members have reached the citadel.” “The vessel is currently drifting 200 nautical miles, South West Bonny and 40 nautical miles, South East of the Eastern fringe of the Nigerian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). “This latest incident sits 40 nautical miles South East of a boarding incident which occured on the 31 of Dec 2019 where the Bulk carrier VINALINES MIGHTY was boarded by three pirates. “This latest incident is the 5th incident to occur within the Nigeria – Sao Tome JDZ since November 2019. “It is assessed that after a brief hiatus, pirates have returned to an area that saw considerable success within 2019.
