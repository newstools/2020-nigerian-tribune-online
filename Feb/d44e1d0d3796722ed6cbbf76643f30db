Experts across different sectors of the nation’s economy have stressed the need  for individuals and corporate organisations to uphold high ethical standards,  to enable them survive the trying economic times in Nigeria. Delivering a Keynote Address on ‘Upholding Ethical Standards in a Challenged Economy’,  at the 2020 Ethics in Business and Professions Seminar, organized by Rotary District 9110, in Lagos,  Barrister Tomi Vincent argued that the myriad of challenges, faced in the country, had made individuals and corporate organisations, desperate for survival. According to him, since times were becoming increasingly tougher, a lot of corporate organisations and individuals had resorted to getting things done through conventional and unconventional means. The Law, Taxation and Policy lecturer of the School of Media  and Communications, Pan-Atlantic University,  however  expressed the belief that the permanent solution to the challenges plaguing the economy would never be found  in indulgence in such unwholesome responses. “A veritable way of doing this would be found in the channels of ethical standards,” he argued.

Giving personal examples, the former Chairman of the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) narrated how  he  was once faced with such pressure from friends and acquaintances , who saw his statutory three-year term, as the head of the apex regulatory council in the nation’s marketing communications space, as an opportunity to better his lots. “To ward off such pressure, I deliberately made sure I was never a signatory to  any of the Council’s accounts, while ensuring that due processes were followed in every of the agency’s activities,” he added. The former APCON boss added that, insisting on ethical standards could have its own consequences. He however believed that the enormous benefits inherent in such action quite outweigh the disadvantages. The District Governor, Dr. Jide Akeredolu, explained that the decision, by the District, to organise the business seminar was informed by the need to bring to the fore some fundamental issues  hampering the growth of the nation’s economy. While expressing the organisation’s commitment to positively impact lives of the people in its operating environments, Akeredolu added that one of the ways is by ensuring that every member of the organization walk ‘the integrity talk’, to enable them serve as role models wherever they find themselves.
