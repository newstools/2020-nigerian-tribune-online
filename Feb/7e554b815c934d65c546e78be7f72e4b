Journalism is a noble profession and its standard should not be degraded by any media outfit that operates as online media, electronic media or print media. The news story of Opera News, an online medium, on Wednesday, January 29, 2020, with a title: ‘Divorce our marriage or I will kill my husband’, carried the picture of a lady who is yet to get married as the picture of a woman who threatened to kill her husband if their marriage is not dissolved. After so many hours, you replaced her picture with another woman in hijab, covering her entire body including the face. Your second picture is still not the right picture for the story since you don’t even know and have the picture of the real woman. Ogun governor’s wife partners FCMB to empower 150… BREAKING: INEC fixes date for Edo, Ondo governorship… EFCC arraigns four for counterfeit currency in Makurdi Trump, Kenyan President Kenyatta to meet at White House The news story in question lacks objectivity, fairness, balance and accuracy that are pillars of every news story.    I would advise that you hurriedly issue an apology to Miss Mima Angulu the same way you hurriedly published her picture as the woman that threatened to kill her husband. Miss Mima is the owner of Krump Dance Studios, a scriptwriter, a dancer, actress and many more. She is indeed a public figure. Your timely apology may save you from a lawsuit.
