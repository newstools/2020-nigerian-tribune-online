People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain, Chief Sunny Onuesoke, has faulted the release of no fewer than 1,400 suspected Boko Haram captives by the Federal Government. Onuesoke said releasing the captives under the guise of ‘Repentant Boko Haram’ was setting bad precedence to Nigerian soldiers, police and civilian JTF who are losing their lives daily in the course of fighting the dissidents at the battlefield. The former Delta State Governorship aspirant said it was amazing that people charged with treason and mass murders were rehabilitated, forced to accept repentance, clothed and fed with public resources then unleashed back to the society without any form of bond.

Our security will continue to sweep across the bushes to flush these people out, and then the government will release them. Does that not amount to wasted efforts? “How do you expect the police and soldiers fighting these terrorists to feel, knowing that the killers can come out tomorrow with a claim of repentance and they will be reabsorbed straight back into the society. “Why should a soldier risk his life defending such a nation? A nation that regards the life of terrorists more than that of an unknown soldier. “Why should America open her door to citizens of a country that celebrate terrorists and treat them with kid gloves?” Onuesoke queried. The PDP Chieftain, who claimed he is suspicious of the reason behind the release of the captured insurgents, accused the government of sympathizing with Boko Haram, alleging that they see an attack on Boko Haram an attack on the North. He argued that if the reason for setting the Boko Haram captives free was because they have repented, it would be better to as well share questionnaires to prisons in Nigeria to ascertain those that are remorseful and repentant of their sins to be released. “Why do you need to arrest them in the first place? Wiping them out during confrontation is the only solution to terrorism. With this recycling moves, I can attest that the fight against Boko Haram will be endless,” he stated SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
