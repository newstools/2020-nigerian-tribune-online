The Anambra State Commissioner for Public Utilities, Engineer Emeka Ezenwanne, has called on the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) to endeavour to bridge the communication gap between the company and electricity consumers in the state by educating and sensitising people properly on its activities. Speaking at a one-day community empowerment workshop organised by officials of the company at the Ministry of Public Utilities in Awka, the Commissioner attributed most of the problems between the EEDC and consumers to communication gap.

In his speech, the Acting Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Utilities, Reverend Dr Polycarp Amanzechukwu, called on the EEDC Officials to adjust their position on the meter withdrawal issue to alleviate the sufferings of the people. Some of the participants, who spoke during the workshop, called on the EEDC to check the activities of some of its staff in the field so that consumers will have value for their money. The leader of the team, Mr Umueze had earlier said that the workshop was to bridge the communication gap between the company and consumers as well as know their feelings and how to improve their service to them. He called for the banning of incandescent light bulbs to ensure steady energy supply and thanked the commissioner for his quality presentation. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
