The Kaduna State Fire Service said it recorded 87 fire outbreaks and seven deaths in January 2020. Mr Paul Aboi, director of the service made this known on Saturday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna. Aboi said the fire outbreaks were recorded in Kaduna Zaria and Kafanchan. He said the outbreaks were caused mainly by carelessness in the use of electrical appliances and ignorance in handling naked fires. The director said January usually recorded a high rate of fire incidences because it was a core dry season.
