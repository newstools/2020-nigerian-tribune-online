Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has disclosed plans by the federal government to speedily recruit more soldiers to tackle worsening insecurity in the country. Speaking while receiving northern clergymen under the auspices of the Arewa Pastors Forum for Peace in Abuja on Monday, he said government was also considering how to provide more equipment and platforms for the military. According to a statement issued by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, in Abuja, there was “an ongoing deliberate and comprehensive consolidation of the security situation in the country including plans to recruit more troops and officers to beef up the personnel of security agencies in order to contain the threats and security concerns in the land.” According to the statement, the Vice President, assured the pastors “we are doing everything that needs to be done.” The statement quoted him further: “We are handling security well, and as you know, including military deployment in diverse fields, like the Boko Haram in the Northeast.

How do we beef up the numbers? How do we recruit more soldiers, both men and women into the army? How do we collaborate more with local vigilante, the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) and all that,” “So, there is a lot going on in terms of trying to beef up security. The security situation is one that is very challenging. We are also looking at aspects of surveillance – how we can do more aerial surveillance using drones and electronic devices to improve surveillance.” Osinbajo assured the clergymen that the Federal Government was also committed to finding lasting solutions to the perennial crisis in communities in the North and other parts of the country, including the ones bothering on religious prejudices. He urged the group as ‘Men of God,” to also come up with ideas and their thoughts on how to find lasting peace. Earlier in his remark, President of the Forum, Bishop Mbayo Japhet said the group’s visit to the Presidential Villa was to support the administration and the Vice President, describing him as an apostle of peace.
