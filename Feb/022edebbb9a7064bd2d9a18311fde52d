For the past 10 years, the scourge of kidnapping has escalated while thousands have been killed. This has discouraged scores of foreign investors and created fear in Nigerians while it has also rendered security agents useless despite their gallant efforts to reduce the scourge. Hence, it is high time to make stiff laws like death sentence on kidnappers and ritualists; doing these will drastically reduce the crime rate. President Muhammadu Buhari should make it a priority to instigate the upper houses to speed action on it. Also, there is a need to provide employment to reduce high social vices. The rate at which  high crimes escalates in Nigeria everyday is worrisome, notable among which are Boko Haram insurgency, kidnapping, banditry and ritual killings. Relieving service chiefs of their duties cannot solve the scourge; they have been doing their best. Social vices have been around for long; these increase unemployment level instigates crime. The only solution is to create employment for our young school leavers because an idle hand is the devil’s workshop. Why Do People Think E-learning in Africa is a Good Idea?
