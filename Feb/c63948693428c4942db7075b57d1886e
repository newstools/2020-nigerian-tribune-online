A deal could be reached for Anthony Joshua vs Tyson Fury match in “a two-minute call” but Deontay Wilder would be much more difficult, according to promoter Eddie Hearn. Wilder defends his WBC heavyweight championship against Fury on February 22 in Las Vegas before Joshua is expected to put his IBF, WBA and WBO belts at stake against Kubrat Pulev with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in pole position to host. “Wilder said he has no interest in Joshua, and Joshua is irrelevant. That is baffling,” Joshua’s promoter Hearn said in an interview. “That’s why I want Fury to win because I know he’s up for it! One phone call with me, [Fury’s US-based promoter] Bob Arum and [Fury’s management] MTK. “AJ wants to fight Fury, Fury wants to fight AJ. It’s a two-minute call with MTK and Bob Arum, done deal. “But I’m not sure who will win [Wilder vs Fury 2]. The comments worry me that we’re in the same position.

They have already spoken about fighting later in 2020, for a third time, regardless of the result later this month. Joshua has previously revealed that a “curveball” offer could tempt either Wilder or Fury to fight him, instead of each other. “The curveball is in terms of; those guys are preparing for their [third fight] and we have an opportunity in place that we can present to the winner to move them away from [a third fight],” Hearn explained. “If the loser wants [a third fight] then we’re tied.” Wilder appeared to distance himself from an undisputed world title fight after claiming that Joshua was “out of the picture” and branded the unified champion as a “coward”.
