How would you describe yourself, what is your growing up like? Tunde Oladimeji is an actor, filmmaker, writer, director and TV anchor; a simple and quiet individual from Iwo town in Osun State and married with kids. I am the first born of my family; my late mum was a teacher, while my father is a licensed surveyor. I grew in a home where there is freedom of choice and tremendous support in a family where Yoruba Language was seriously engaged as the lingua franca.  How did you get into the movie industry? I actually got into movies while I was in higher institution; it was during my days at the University of Ibadan. I actually started on stage and co-produced my first film while I was a 300 level student. The movie was titled ‘Agbalagba Akan’, an adaptation of the book of the same title by Oladejo Okediji. That was my ticket into the industry.  You were recently nominated for the AMVCAs in its documentary category, how do you feel about the nomination? Sincerely, I wasn’t expecting it. So, it came as a surprise and a good feeling actually. Interestingly It is the only Indigenous language (Yoruba) nominated in that category. It’s one in a series of documentaries talking about the beauty, history, culture and grandeur of Yoruba cities.  It’s titled ‘Ibadan Ajorosun’.  If you win, how will it affect your profession? If I win, hopefully it will open more doors and will be a pointer to the fact that in arts, language is less important than quality.

Oh yes, being nominated among several other practitioners is an achievement on its own and it’s worthy of celebration, especially if you consider the status of the AMVCA award; it is arguably the most visible and one of the most glamorous awards; on the continent right now. I hope and pray that the nomination will propel others like us to also aspire to do things like this. They could even do better really.  You are an actor and presenter, what inspired you to do documentary production? I have experimented with many things along my sojourn in the arts. However, I love story telling. The truth is we narrate stories all the time in movies, TV shows and radio because there must always be a story. However, documentary storytelling, especially history and the way of life of people, is absolutely special. I was inspired to do these documentaries by my need to celebrate and inform the African people about their past; this will inform their present and mould the future. We must take pride in our history and let it propel us to do more.  Are there specific messages you want to pass with your documentary? Yes, like I said, the message is that we must know who we are and what those before us achieved so we can work harder to achieve more. It’s basically to inspire us to greatness.  Are you still into acting or you are just focused on production? I’m still very much into acting and I have lots of movies that I featured in that have been released now. There are movies like ‘Akekaka’ by Jaiye Kuti, ‘Oja Okunkun’ which I wrote, directed and produced ,so many more  Getting finance for projects is a challenge, how do you navigate this to finance your projects? Oh yes! Finance, that’s a pretty huge obstacle we all face. Getting financing for productions is creating lots of stress for filmmakers. However, I have been a bit lucky to get finance for these documentaries. I have a good working relationship with Rare Edge studios, the producers of ‘Aajiirebi’, ‘Awon Aladun De’ and ‘Borokini’, among other top notch productions. It’s been a fantastic experience. It has afforded me the opportunity to have creative control and worry less about money.  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
