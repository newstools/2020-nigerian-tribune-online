The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) demanding for a fresh governorship election in Bayelsa. Mr Yekini Nabena, the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said this at a news conference on Sunday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Supreme Court had on Thursday nullified the election of APC governorship candidate in Bayelsa, David Lyon. Nabena said that the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, made the request in a letter to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu titled: “Judgement in Appeal No: SC.1/2020 between Peoples Democratic Party and APC”. According to him, APC has formally demanded a fresh governorship election in Bayelsa. “The party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, while affirming the supremacy of the Apex Court, forwarded a letter to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu titled: Judgement in Appeal No: SC.1/2020 between Peoples Democratic Party and APC, requesting for the conduct of fresh governorship election in Bayelsa,” he said.

We are all aware of the NYSC certificate forgery case of the Bayelsa deputy governor, Sen. Lawrence Oborawharievwo Ewhrudjakpo. “And the decision of the APC national leadership to continue to pursue all legal avenues to contest INEC’s decision to declare Duoye Diri as Bayelsa governor, having failed to meet the mandatory constitutional requirement to become the governor,” he said. He urged all lovers of democracy to ensure that the rule of law was adhered to, not only in the case of Bayelsa but in all matters. According to him, democracy is a game of numbers and the majority must have their way. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
