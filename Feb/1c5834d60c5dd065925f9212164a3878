The decision on whether or not to use such toys are personal and can often be controversial. Unfortunately, some of the toys are made with chemicals that are not safe for the human body. These chemicals can cause itching, burning, rashes, and tissue damage. Other chemicals have been linked to male fertility issues, breast cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, asthma. Other chemicals may affect the foetus of a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding. They also have harmful effects on the central nervous system. A handy trick for checking sex toys made from unsafe materials is the smell test. If a product has a strong smell, that’s a good indicator that cheap, unsafe materials were used to make it.
