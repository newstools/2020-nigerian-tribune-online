In its determined efforts to provide tertiary healthcare for the people, Gombe state government has disclosed that it is planning to procure nine dialysis machines to equip the dialysis centre of the Specialist Hospital, Gombe. The disclosure was made by the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Ahmed Gana in an interactive session with Journalists in Gombe, on Friday, saying that the nine dialysis machines will be used for a different line of patients’ management. He also said that the previous administration awarded the contract for the procurement of the machines but the contractor was not mobilized and so abandoned the contract pointing out that the present administration will make the procurement a reality in order to ease the sufferings of kidney patients who go to other states for dialysis. The Commissioner further decried the deplorable condition of facilities in some of the hospitals in the state particularly the General Hospitals in Dukku, Nafada, Akko and Billiri.
