Contrary to reports making rounds about an ailing actor, Ernest Azuzu, who was said to have received healing during his visit to Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) some years back, Nigerian Tribune reliably gathered that Azuzu never visited SCOAN but rather Christ MercyLand Deliverance Ministry, in Warri, Delta State. Azuzu who is currently down with stroke hit the headlines last week in a video where he appeared shirtless and begging for alms as many wondered how his health deteriorated after his alleged visit to the church.

In a video made available to Nigerian Tribune, Azuzu was received by the founder of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry, Warri, Delta State, Prophet Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin. Years after he was reported to have been healed by Prophet Fufeyin, Azuzu was seen in a very deplorable condition, ill and begging for help on social media. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
