The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has reiterated the plan to fully implement the cashless policy which is expected to ensure swift and seamless payments as from March 31, 2020, the deadline for all customers to comply. So far only Kano, Rivers, Ogun, Anambra, Lagos, Abia and FCT have complied, Director, Corporate Communications department of the bank, Mr Isaac Okoroafor has disclosed. Speaking at the bank’s fair in Asaba, Delta state with theme, “Promoting Financial and Economic Development” on Monday, Okoroafor said the bank had been sensitising the people on the policy to disabuse their minds on dangers of carrying plenty of money at all time.

Additional states; Abia, Anambra, Kano, Ogun and Rivers States, as well as Abuja, were added in Phase 2, and it started on October 1, 2013.
