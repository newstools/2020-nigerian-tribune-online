Students of Oke Bola Comprehensive High School, Ibadan and their neighbouring Ibadan Municipal Grammar School clashed on Wednesday, vandalising properties and cars parked around the area. The clash, it was gathered, was ignited by a fight by two students of the different schools only for it to be escalated by friends who attempted to support their own. Confirming the incident, Oyo Police Public Relations Officer, Gbenga Fadeyi, said 10 students across the two schools had been arrested. While stating that no casualties were recorded, he said the arrests were made to prevent further degeneration of the clash.

As part of interrogation at Iyaganku police station, Fadeyi pointed out that parents of those arrested had been invited. “The students of the two schools engaged themselves in a fight and the police responded promptly to it so that the others don’t come around to make the situation degenerate. “In the process, the police arrested 10 of them and the Commissioner of Police gave the directive that their parents be invited so that the students can be talked to, appealed to, to prevent the situation from degenerating into serious conflict. “Investigation has commenced into the matter to unravel the cause of the clash but I don’t think it is a cult clash. The police in conjunction with Area Commander and Divisional Police Officer, Iyaganku are on it as they are being interrogated at Iyaganku police station,” Fadeyi said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
