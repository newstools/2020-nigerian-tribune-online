President of Apostolic Church of Christ Worldwide, Apostle (Dr) Kehinde Sangoade, has urged the South-West governors not to be intimidated over the full implementation of its security initiative called Operation Amotekun. He said that the governors had taken the right step in the right direction to protect the people, just as he said they had the constitutional rights to institute  such security initiative for the protection of lives and properties. Speaking at the ordination service for pastors of the church at ACC Cathedral Gbelekale, Ibadan,  Oyo State, Apostle Sangogade commended South-West governors for their efforts to make the initiative a reality.
