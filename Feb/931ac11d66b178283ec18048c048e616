Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said it is probing alleged diversion of over N3billion meant for operation Light-Up Kwara (LUK) project by the immediate past administration of Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed. Speaking during “Nigerian youth walk against corruption” protest, organized by the anti-graft agency in collaboration with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), organized labour, civil society organizations (CBOs), etc, in Ilorin on Friday, Zonal Head of the EFCC, Isyaku Sharu said that “part of the diverted fund was used to buy a property in Guzape area of Abuja”. Sharu also said that the commission had in its one year of operation, secured 48 convictions with worth of recoveries both in cash and assets totalling N8.5 billion. “Substantial part of this recovery was for the Kwara state government. You will recall that during the last international anti-corruption day, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq commended the EFCC for assisting the state government in recovering the N4.8 billion tax refund at the eve of the last handing/taking over.

Governor Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq, who participated in the walk, repeated President Muhammadu Buhari’s refrain that corruption would kill the country if the country fails to kill the cancer that is responsible for the slow pace of development. “We have been walking the talk, now we are walking in support of the war (against corruption). The message is very clear: kill corruption or it will kill us all,” he said. “We have to do the right thing and be cautious. We have seen what has happened to those that have been in (this) position before us. Nobody wants to leave office and be going to EFCC’s office daily. So, we will do the right thing in Kwara State state. We appreciate the EFCC, they had earlier given us over N100million. They have invited us (again) to collect another N200m (recovered looted funds); they have made a lot of progress.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
