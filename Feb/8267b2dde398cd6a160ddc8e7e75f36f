Former governor of Ogun State, Chief Gbenga Daniel, has tasked the Federal and State governments to prioritize job creation as a way to address the challenge of unemployment and insecurity in the system. He made this known on Wednesday, in Abeokuta, at the launch and public presentation of a book titled” Wisdom Nuggets for Daily Living”, authored by the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Public Communications, Pastor Remmy Hazzan. Daniel bemoaned the state of insecurity in the country, positing that government was not doing enough to stem the tide of wanton killings of citizens. He noted that job creation by the government at the two levels would make many unemployed ones to be meaningfully engaged. “The biggest challenge we have, people talk about insecurity, but it’s information. We need to continually educate our people, give them quality information because where information is missing, all sorts of mischief happens and the nation can be destroyed.

The way I look at it security is more than getting ammunitions and chasing ourselves. People must be given employment. The first thing is to make sure that people are employed. It’s after that you will be able to see who constitutes a security risk. So, for me, providing employment for our people is the first thing we need to do to tackle security issues,” he said. The author in his remarks said the book is a daily inspirational message for spiritual growth. On state security in the country, Hazzan advocated for community policing to checkmate crimes and criminality. He said, “One of the problems of the police in the present time is the fact that, as much as they are willing to work, they know little or nothing about the difficult terrains of the localities they find themselves. ” So wisdom means that you translate the knowledge into a proper application and community policing is the proper application of policing knowledge so that you can gather intelligence that will help you nip crime in the bud.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
