Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said that the World Bank’s projection on the increasing number of destitutes in Nigeria should be a wake-up call. The governor who lamented the huge number of graduate churned out in the country without corresponding job opportunities said that the country may be heading into danger if nothing is done to arrest the situation. Consequently, he called on the Federal government not to dismiss the projection of over 80 million destitute in the country. Ortom urged the Federal Government to focus more attention on the way to create an enabling environment for industries to thrive in the country. The governor gave the warning while speaking to journalists after a courtesy visit on him by The Feed The Future Nigeria Agric Business Investment Activity led by its deputy chief of party, Faruk Lawan.
